  <h1>Bees in Agriculture</h1>
  <p>Bees play an essential role in global agriculture, providing pollination services that underpin food security and ecosystem health. More than 75% of food crops depend to some degree on animal pollination, and bees are among the most effective and versatile pollinators.</p>

  <h2>Pollination and Crop Yields</h2>
  <p>When bees visit flowers to collect nectar and pollen, they transfer pollen between plants. This fertilisation process improves fruit set, seed production, and crop quality. In many systems, bee-pollinated crops see higher yields and more uniform produce compared to wind-pollinated or self-pollinated plants.</p>

  <h2>Economic Value</h2>
  <p>The economic contribution of bees to agriculture is measured in billions of pounds each year. Crops such as apples, almonds, berries, cucumbers, and oilseed rape are heavily reliant on bee pollination. Without bees, production costs would rise and availability of these foods would decline.</p>

  <h2>Farming Practices and Bee Health</h2>
  <p>Modern agriculture can both support and threaten bees. Practices such as monocropping and pesticide use may harm pollinator populations, while wildflower margins, cover crops, and integrated pest management create safer, more diverse forage. Farmers increasingly recognise the mutual benefits of protecting bees.</p>

  <h2>Climate Change and Pollination</h2>
  <p>Climate change is shifting flowering times and altering crop-pollinator interactions. Resilient systems depend on maintaining diverse pollinator communities and adapting farm management to support them. Beekeepers, growers, and researchers are collaborating to track and manage these changes.</p>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p>Safeguarding bee populations is a cornerstone of sustainable agriculture. By creating pollinator-friendly landscapes, farmers not only protect biodiversity but also secure consistent, high-quality harvests for the future.</p>
