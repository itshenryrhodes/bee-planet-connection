  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Honey bee physiology examines the structures and systems that enable Apis
    mellifera to thrive as highly social insects. Their bodies are divided into
    three main parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. Each region is specialised
    for sensory processing, locomotion, and reproduction. Understanding bee
    physiology provides a foundation for beekeepers, scientists, and educators
    working to support healthy colonies.

  <h2>Anatomy and Body Segmentation</h2>
  <p>
    The <strong>head</strong> houses compound eyes, ocelli, antennae, and mouthparts.
    The <strong>thorax</strong> contains the wing muscles and legs, designed for
    flight and pollen collection. The <strong>abdomen</strong> carries digestive,
    reproductive, and defensive structures, including the sting in workers and
    queens.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Sensory Systems</h2>
  <p>
    Bees rely heavily on their sensory equipment. Compound eyes detect movement
    and ultraviolet light, revealing patterns invisible to humans. Antennae are
    covered in chemoreceptors, enabling bees to detect pheromones and floral
    scents. Vibrational sensitivity through body hairs and Johnston’s organ in
    the antennae supports navigation and communication within the hive.

<section>
  <h2>Circulatory and Respiratory Systems</h2>
  <p>
    Honey bees circulate haemolymph (insect blood) through an open system. A
    dorsal vessel functions as a heart, pumping haemolymph toward the head. Gas
    exchange occurs through spiracles located along the thorax and abdomen,
    feeding oxygen directly into tissues via branching tracheae.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Digestive System</h2>
  <p>
    The digestive system includes a honey stomach (crop) for nectar storage, a
    midgut for digestion, and Malpighian tubules for excretion. Nectar collected
    during foraging is enzymatically transformed into honey, providing the colony
    with energy stores. Pollen supplies essential proteins and fats, sustaining
    brood development.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Nervous and Endocrine Systems</h2>
  <p>
    Despite its small size, the bee brain supports remarkable behaviours such as
    navigation, memory, and symbolic communication through the waggle dance.
    Neurohormones regulate division of labour, shifting workers from nursing to
    foraging as they age.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Reproductive Biology</h2>
  <p>
    Queens have fully developed ovaries capable of laying up to 2,000 eggs per
    day in peak season. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and exist
    primarily to mate with virgin queens. Workers are functionally sterile, yet
    play crucial roles in brood care and hive maintenance.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Colony-Level Physiology</h2>
  <p>
    Individual physiology scales up to the superorganism. Thermoregulation is
    achieved by wing fanning to cool the hive or clustering to conserve heat.
    Pheromones maintain colony cohesion, regulate reproduction, and coordinate
    defence. Collective behaviours allow the hive to adapt dynamically to
    environmental pressures.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Applied Importance</h2>
  <p>
    Studying honey bee physiology informs pest and disease management, breeding
    for resilience, and understanding environmental stressors. Beekeepers draw on
    this knowledge to recognise early signs of colony decline and to implement
    practices that support bee health.
