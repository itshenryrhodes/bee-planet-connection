<h1>Knowledge in Apiculture</h1>

<p>
  The study of apiculture (beekeeping) encompasses a wide range of knowledge —
  from honey bee biology and behaviour, to hive management, pollination
  services, and the cultural role of bees across human history.
</p>

<p>
  This section of the wiki serves as a hub for exploring apiculture knowledge
  across multiple dimensions, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bee biology</strong> — anatomy, physiology, behaviour, and genetics.</li>
  <li><strong>Beekeeping practices</strong> — hive management, seasonal strategies, and equipment.</li>
  <li><strong>Bee products</strong> — honey, wax, propolis, pollen, royal jelly, and their uses.</li>
  <li><strong>Environmental interactions</strong> — forage ecology, pollination, and biodiversity.</li>
  <li><strong>Societal role</strong> — history, tradition, and modern cultural impact of beekeeping.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The articles in the wiki expand on these areas to provide a comprehensive
  knowledge base for beekeepers, researchers, and enthusiasts alike.
