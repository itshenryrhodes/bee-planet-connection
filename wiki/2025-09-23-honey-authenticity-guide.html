<h1>Honey Authenticity Guide</h1>

<p>
  Honey authenticity is a major concern for consumers, regulators, and
  producers. Fraudulent practices such as adulteration with sugar syrups or
  mislabelling of floral and geographic origin undermine trust and reduce the
  value of genuine honey.
</p>

<h2>Key Methods for Testing Authenticity</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Physical and chemical analysis</strong> — moisture content, HMF levels, electrical conductivity.</li>
  <li><strong>Spectroscopic methods</strong> — FTIR, NMR, and isotope analysis for detecting adulterants.</li>
  <li><strong>Pollen analysis (melissopalynology)</strong> — determining botanical and geographical origin.</li>
  <li><strong>DNA-based methods</strong> — barcoding and sequencing to identify plant sources.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Global Standards</h2>
<p>
  International frameworks such as the Codex Alimentarius and EU honey
  directives set benchmarks for quality, labelling, and authenticity testing.
</p>

<p>
  Strengthening transparency across the supply chain — from beekeeper to
  retailer — helps ensure consumers receive authentic, high-quality honey while
  protecting the livelihoods of honest producers.
