# Heather honey processing

## What It Is
Ling heather yields thixotropic honey that gels at rest and liquefies under shear. It is prized for intense flavour and regional identity.

## Harvesting & Processing
Super strong colonies before the heather flow. Use prickers or uncapping needles to break gel structure; press or specialist extractors may be required. Warm rooms aid flow but avoid overheating; filter gently to retain desirable colloids.

## Properties & Uses
Distinct jelly-like set, dark amber colour, and high colloid content. Often marketed as a premium, region-labelled product.

## Market & Value
Commands a premium with trusted provenance; small-batch bottling and storytelling matter.
