## Types & Variants
Langstroth/National: modular, high yield, heavier lifts. Top-bar: simple inspections, natural comb, limited expansion. Warr√©: quilt box moisture control, bottom-addition stacking.

## Using It Well
Keep frames square; rotate old comb; maintain boxes and roofs; use open-mesh floors for ventilation/Varroa drop where appropriate.

## Costs & Practicalities
Wood vs poly trade-offs (durability vs insulation/weight). Consider frame counts and box sizes to manage lift weight.

## Recent Innovations
Flow frames for direct draw-off; IoT scales and acoustic/temp monitoring; safer OA delivery devices.
