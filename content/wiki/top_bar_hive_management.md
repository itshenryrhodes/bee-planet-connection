# Top bar hive management

## Overview
Top-bar hives prioritise simplicity and natural comb, trading off honey yield and standardisation. They suit low-lift beekeeping and observational goals while demanding attentive comb management.

## Types & Variants
Common patterns include Kenyan (sloped sides) and Tanzanian (straight sides). Bars use guides or beveled edges to encourage straight comb; windows aid inspection without dismantling.

## Using It Well
Keep hives level and bars square; insert new bars between straight, drawn comb to prevent cross-comb. Manage space incrementally to avoid collapses in hot weather. Harvest by cutting comb and straining, leaving enough stores for the colony.

## Costs & Practicalities
Materials are inexpensive and lifts are light, but extraction is labour-intensive and standard frames/supers are incompatible with stacked hive systems.

## Recent Innovations
Hybrid systems pair TBH brood nests with superable boxes for honey; modular bars and better observation windows reduce disturbance during inspections.

## Further Reading & Sources
Consult dedicated TBH management guides for spacing, bar design, and seasonal workflows. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
