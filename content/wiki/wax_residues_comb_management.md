# Wax residues comb management

## What It Is
Beeswax accumulates environmental residues over time. Proactive comb rotation and careful sourcing of foundation manage risk for both bee health and product quality.

## Harvesting & Processing
Segregate cappings (cleaner) from brood wax. Render gently; filter progressively. Keep batch records linking wax to yards and seasons. When purchasing foundation, request residue testing statements if available.

## Properties & Uses
Old brood wax darkens and carries higher residue loads; cappings wax fetches higher cosmetic grades. Transparency on source and handling builds trust.

## Market & Value
Brands that evidence clean wax and traceability command premiums. Recycling your own cappings into foundation closes loops if quality controls are strong.
