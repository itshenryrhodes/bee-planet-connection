## Snapshot
Pollination services can out-earn honey in some crops but concentrate operational risk into short windows.

## Supply & Demand
Demand peaks around specific blooms (e.g., almonds). Growers want strong, even colonies placed on a schedule aligned to flowering stages.

## Revenue Streams
Per-hive fees, strength guarantees, and replacement provisions structure deals. Some beekeepers negotiate contingency clauses for bad bloom years.

## Risks & Compliance
Include no-spray clauses during bloom, notification rules for any applications, site access, liability/insurance details, and record-keeping expectations. Photograph pre/post placements and log hive strength.
