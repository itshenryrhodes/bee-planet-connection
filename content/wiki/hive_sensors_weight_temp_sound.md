# Hive sensors weight temp sound

## Overview
Affordable scales, temperature probes, and acoustic sensors turn hives into data sources. Trends reveal nectar flows, brood breaks, queen events, and stressâ€”supporting faster, evidence-led decisions.

## Types & Variants
Under-hive load cells track daily weight change; in-hive probes measure brood nest stability; microphones capture piping/roaring signatures. Gate counters track traffic volume and forager return.

## Using It Well
Calibrate sensors, protect against weather, and log data at consistent intervals. Interpret trends rather than single points: sudden evening weight jumps suggest robbing; flat lines in flow season may indicate queen issues.

## Costs & Practicalities
DIY kits lower costs but need maintenance; commercial platforms offer dashboards, alerts, and APIs. Power and connectivity (solar, LoRaWAN, LTE) drive siting choices.

## Recent Innovations
Machine-learning classifiers flag swarming precursors or queen loss from sound/weight patterns; integrated weather feeds contextualise anomalies.
