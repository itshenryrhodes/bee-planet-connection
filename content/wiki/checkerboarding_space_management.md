# Checkerboarding space management

## At-a-Glance
Checkerboarding places drawn and undrawn comb alternately above the brood nest before swarm season to disrupt nectar backfilling and relieve congestion. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Why it Matters
Swarm impulse builds when the brood nest is compressed and foragers backfill with nectar. Providing mixed comb encourages processing without blocking brood expansion.

## Step-by-Step
Before the main flow, add a super with alternating drawn and foundation frames over the brood nest. Maintain proper spacing and monitor progress weekly. Combine with timely supering and, if needed, brood nest expansion. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
