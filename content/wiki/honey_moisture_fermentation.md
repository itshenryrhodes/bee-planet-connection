# Honey moisture fermentation

## What It Is
Moisture above ~18% risks fermentation; controlling water content preserves flavour and shelf life.

## Harvesting & Processing
Cap only fully sealed combs when possible; use warm rooms/dehumidification to finish uncapped frames; strain and settle gently; measure with a refractometer.

## Properties & Uses
Varietals differ in moisture tendency; heather thixotropy and high-glucose honeys require adapted handling.

## Market & Value
Stable, low-moisture honey retains value and avoids returns; record moisture by batch for quality assurance.
