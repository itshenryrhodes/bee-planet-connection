## Step-by-Step
Maritime: prioritise moisture control (vented floors, quilt/moisture boards), check stores frequently. Continental/alpine: add insulation/windbreaks, reduce entrances, ensure ample stores and rodent guards. All zones: low Varroa before winter, stable equipment, accessible fondant/candy if needed.
