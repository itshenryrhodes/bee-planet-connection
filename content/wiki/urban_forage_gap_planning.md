## Drivers & Mechanisms
Early: willow/ornamentals; mid: lime/parks; late: ivy/rooftop planters. Drought and mowing policy shift timing.

## Impacts & Case Studies
City bloom is patchy. Map micro-flows (street trees, parks, balconies) to bridge dearths with planting and feeding plans.

## Mitigation & Best Practice
Coordinate with building managers for planter choices; stagger blooms; avoid pesticide-treated ornamentals.
