# Nosema ceranae vs apis management

## Overview
Nosema is a microsporidian gut parasite of adult honey bees. Nosema apis historically caused spring dysentery and sluggish build-up; Nosema ceranae now predominates in many regions and presents more insidiously year-round, depressing foraging and lifespan without obvious diarrhoea. Subclinical loads still reduce performance, so management aims to minimise stressors and keep colonies strong.

## Biology & Transmission
Spores are ingested via contaminated food, comb, and beekeeper handling. They germinate in the midgut, damaging epithelial cells and impairing nutrient uptake. Ceranae tolerates warmer conditions and may persist through summer; apiary practices that share comb or feed between colonies can propagate infection.

## Symptoms & Field Diagnosis
Apis often coincides with spring dysentery and crawling bees; ceranae tends to be covert, showing as poor build-up, dwindling, and queen issues. Confirm with microscopy or lab tests on pooled adult bee samples. Track trends across seasons rather than one-off readings.

## Impact on Colony
Reduced worker longevity and foraging return impair brood care and honey production. Chronic pressure exacerbates queen supersedure and increases winter losses, especially when coupled with varroa, dearth, or moisture stress.

## Control & Treatment
There is no silver-bullet field cure used universally. Focus on nutrition, moisture/ventilation control, comb rotation, and minimising stress. Where legally permitted, veterinary products may be prescribed; follow local guidance strictly, observing withdrawal periods and labels.

## Prevention & Good Practice
Avoid sharing suspect comb, disinfect feeders/tools, ensure abundant early nutrition, and maintain dry, well-ventilated hives. Requeen chronic cases and retire old dark brood comb methodically.
