# Snelgrove board swarm control

## At-a-Glance
The Snelgrove method manipulates bee movement using a division board with closable entrances, bleeding young bees down to the queen while allowing brood above to emerge. It curbs swarming without losing foraging strength. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Step-by-Step
Find and leave the queen with eggs/young brood below. Place the Snelgrove board and brood above with queen cells broken down except one if increase is desired. Open and close specific board entrances over a 7â€“10 day schedule to redistribute flyers. Re-inspect to manage cells and space. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
