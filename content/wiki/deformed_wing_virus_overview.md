# Deformed wing virus overview

## At-a-Glance
Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) is a ubiquitous honey bee virus strongly associated with Varroa destructor. Clinical cases show shrunken, crumpled wings and shortened lifespans, but subclinical infections can still depress colony performance. Managing DWV is primarily about suppressing mite vectors and maintaining strong, well-fed colonies. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
