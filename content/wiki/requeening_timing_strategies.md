# Requeening timing strategies

## At-a-Glance
Pre-emptive requeening preserves performance; reactive requeening rescues colonies showing poor brood patterns or temper. Match method and timing to nectar flows and population.

## Why it Matters
Strong queens set colony trajectory for months. Waiting until failure risks lost flows and defensive behaviour that is harder to correct. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Step-by-Step
Pre-emptive: replace 1â€“2 year queens after main flow; introduce a caged, mated queen with candy release. Reactive: verify queenlessness or failure, add open brood to stabilise pheromones, then use a push-in cage over emerging brood for safer acceptance. Log performance pre/post.
