# Comb honey production

## What It Is
Comb honey is honey presented in the original wax combâ€”an artisanal product that commands premiums when clean, even, and well-sealed.

## Harvesting & Processing
Use thin surplus foundation or cut-comb cassettes in strong nectar flows to minimise travel stain. Avoid smoke in supers. Handle frames gently; cut and drain at cool temperatures to preserve structure; package in airtight containers to prevent moisture uptake.

## Properties & Uses
Visual appeal and delicate wax are key selling points. Floral source influences flavour, colour, and granulation; some nectars are better suited to comb presentation than others.

## Market & Value
Premium retail channels value provenance and appearance. Control moisture and hygiene; label clearly with lot/date and origin.
