# Creamed honey crystallisation

## What It Is
Creamed (set) honey is intentionally crystallised to a fine, smooth texture using seed inoculation and controlled temperatures.

## Harvesting & Processing
Start with low-moisture honey. Create a fine-grain seed and blend about 5–10%. Hold near 14°C to favour small crystals; stir gently to avoid air. Jar cleanly and store cool to lock texture.

## Properties & Uses
Fine microcrystals produce a spreadable product that resists separation. Floral source influences behaviour; some honeys benefit from blending.

## Market & Value
Consistent texture and provenance attract retail buyers. Label clearly with batch and origin.

## Further Reading & Sources
Use reputable process charts for temperature/time regimes and checks for granulation stability. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
