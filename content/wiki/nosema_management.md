# Nosema management

## Overview
Nosema is a gut disease of adult bees that reduces longevity, weakens foraging force, and can trigger spring setbacks. The two main species are Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae; both impair colony performance when stress is high.

## Biology & Transmission
Spores are ingested with contaminated food or water and germinate in the beeâ€™s midgut. Ceranae can persist year-round in milder climates; Apis shows stronger seasonality. Stress, poor forage, and high mite loads raise susceptibility.

## Symptoms & Field Diagnosis
Non-specific signs include dysentery on frames in late winter/early spring, poor build-up, dwindling adult population, and failing queens. Definitive diagnosis uses microscopy or lab tests of midgut homogenates.

## Impact on Colony
Reduced worker lifespan and nursing capacity lead to patchy brood, poor honey yields, and winter losses if compounded by Varroa and nutrition gaps.

## Control & Treatment
Focus on prevention: strong colonies, good ventilation, clean water, comb rotation, and replacement of failing queens. Manage Varroa and ensure steady spring forage. Where legal frameworks allow, treatments are vet-directed; many regions emphasise husbandry first.

## Prevention & Good Practice
Keep colonies well fed, reduce stressors, replace old comb, sanitise equipment, and avoid robbing and drifting by sensible apiary layout.
