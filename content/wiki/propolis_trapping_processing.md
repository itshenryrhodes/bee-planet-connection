# Propolis trapping processing

## What It Is
Propolis is a resinous mixture collected from plant buds and used by bees to seal and sanitise cavities; beekeepers can harvest it ethically with mesh traps.

## Harvesting & Processing
Place propolis traps over top bars; cool or freeze to snap resin free; avoid scraping that contaminates with wood/wax. Dissolve in food-grade alcohol for tinctures or filter for raw sale; keep batches labelled and stored cool, dark, and sealed.

## Properties & Uses
Chemistry varies by flora; customers value colour, aroma, and resin content. Used in tinctures, salves, and varnishesâ€”check local regulations on claims.

## Market & Value
Niche but high-margin where provenance and cleanliness are demonstrated; small, consistent batches build loyalty.
