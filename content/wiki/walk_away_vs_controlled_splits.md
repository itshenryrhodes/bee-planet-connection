# Walk away vs controlled splits

## At-a-Glance
Walk-away splits rely on emergency queen rearing; controlled splits use mated queens or ripe cells for predictability. Choose based on timing, goals, and resources.

## Why it Matters
Controlled genetics and faster return to lay reduce brood breaks and lost flows. Walk-away methods are equipment-light but slower and less certain. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Step-by-Step
Walk-away: divide resources, ensure eggs/young larvae in queenless half, return in ~4 weeks to confirm laying. Controlled: pre-order queens or graft cells; time splits to coincide with strong nurse populations; introduce with cages/push-in over emerging brood. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Seasonality & Climate
Best during strong forage and reliable drone availability. Late-season walk-aways risk poor mating and weak build-up. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
