# Beeswax rendering quality

## What It Is
Beeswax from cappings and brood comb is rendered into clean blocks for candles, cosmetics, and food wraps.

## Harvesting & Processing
Melt gently in water baths; filter through cloth; settle and scrape slumgum; repeat for cosmetic grade. Keep brood comb wax separate from cappings for lighter colour.

## Properties & Uses
Colour and aroma vary by forage and comb age. Purity determines suitability for cosmetics and food contact.

## Market & Value
Clean, light cappings wax earns premiums. Label origin and batch for repeat buyers.
