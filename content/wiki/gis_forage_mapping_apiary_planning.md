# Gis forage mapping apiary planning

## Overview
Simple GIS layers (land cover, hedgerows, crop maps) combined with bloom calendars reveal forage gaps and guide optimal apiary placements and flight-line planning.

## Drivers & Mechanisms
Landscape configuration—field size, edge density, and habitat patches—drives nectar continuity. Proximity to water and shelter influences flight efficiency and brood thermoregulation.

## Impacts & Case Studies
Farms adding wildflower margins at field edges saw improved pollinator abundance and fruit set; urban projects used tree inventories to plan staggered bloom in street corridors.

## Mitigation & Best Practice
Map within a 2–3 km radius; prioritise mixed habitats; avoid pesticide drift lines; coordinate with landowners to establish stepping-stone plantings. Reassess annually with crop rotations.

## Further Reading & Sources
Use open land-cover datasets, local crop maps, and pollinator plant lists; store shapefiles with your apiary records for repeatable planning. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
