## Drivers & Mechanisms
Stagger bloom for continuity: early (willow, hazel, mahonia), mid (hawthorn, apple/pear/plum, lime), late (ivy, heather on suitable soils, sweet chestnut). Mix natives with proven ornamentals where appropriate.

## Impacts & Case Studies
Hedgerow restoration and street-tree schemes boost forage diversity, reduce dearths, and support wild pollinators alongside honey bees.

## Mitigation & Best Practice
Match species to soil and exposure; avoid invasive taxa; plan for drought tolerance; coordinate with councils or landowners for long-term maintenance. Plant in blocks/lines to aid bee orientation.

## Further Reading & Sources
Consult reputable UK pollinator plant lists and forestry guidance for species selection and establishment. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
