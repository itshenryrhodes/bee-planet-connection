# Chalkbrood management

## Overview
Chalkbrood (Ascosphaera apis) mummifies larvae into hard, white or grey pellets. It flares in cool, damp springs or in nutritionally or genetically stressed colonies.

## Biology & Transmission
Larvae ingest spores; chilled brood and high humidity favour germination. Spores persist on combs and debris and spread via frames and tools.

## Symptoms & Field Diagnosis
Spotty brood with chalk-like mummies on floors, alighting boards, or in cells. Mummies are lightweight and rattling; distinguish from AFB/EFB by texture and absence of ropiness.

## Impact on Colony
Reduced brood replacement slows spring expansion and can erode honey yields.

## Control & Treatment
Improve ventilation, reduce moisture, replace old brood comb, boost nutrition, and consider requeening from tolerant stock.

## Prevention & Good Practice
Keep strong, well-fed colonies, avoid chilling brood during inspections, and maintain hygiene to reduce spore loads.
