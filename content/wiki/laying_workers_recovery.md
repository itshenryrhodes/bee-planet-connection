Colonies long queenless may develop laying workers producing multiple eggs per cell and drone brood in worker cells. Recovery requires stabilising pheromones and paced queen introduction.

## Step-by-Step
Confirm diagnosis (multiple eggs, bullet cappings, chaotic pattern). Add a frame of open brood weekly for 2â€“3 weeks to suppress laying workers. Combine with a queen-right nuc via newspaper or introduce a caged queen using a push-in cage over emerging brood. Verify eggs/laying pattern after release. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
