# Asian hornet response

## At-a-Glance
The yellow-legged (Asian) hornet, Vespa velutina, predates honey bees at hive entrances and can rapidly destabilise apiaries. Early detection, correct identification, and swift reporting are the priorities; nest destruction is a specialist task. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Why it Matters
Unchecked, Asian hornets reduce foraging, stress colonies, and cause significant pollinator losses. Because single nests can produce large numbers of queens, delays multiply future outbreaks. Coordinated, evidence-led response is the difference between isolated incursions and establishment. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Step-by-Step
1) Confirm ID using official guides/apps (colour, yellow legs, orange band; not the native European hornet). 2) Photograph/video at a safe distance; record time/place. 3) Report immediately via the official channel/app; follow any instructions on baiting or monitoring. 4) Reduce hive stress (robbing screens, strong units, minimal open feed). 5) Do not attempt nest destruction yourself—await trained teams to track and neutralise nests.

## Seasonality & Climate
Spring queens are the critical window: intercepting them prevents nests maturing to produce new queens in late summer/autumn. Warm, dry seasons can amplify spread; expect more hawking behaviour around hive entrances during strong nectar flows. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Common Pitfalls
Self-treating or disturbing nests, misidentifying native species, and broadcasting unverified trap designs that harm non-target insects. Ad hoc trapping without evidence can backfire—use targeted monitoring recommended by authorities. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Tools & Materials
Accredited ID resources/apps, simple monitoring stations (transparent tubs, protein/sugar baits if instructed), robbing screens, entrance reducers, and personal protective equipment.
