# Mite sampling methods

## At-a-Glance
Consistent, quantitative mite sampling beats guesswork. Alcohol washes are the reference standard; sugar rolls and CO₂ give alternatives with different trade-offs.

## Why it Matters
Threshold-based actions prevent over- or under-treating. Comparable results across yards let you evaluate treatment efficacy and resistance risk. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Step-by-Step
Sample ~300 bees from the brood nest. Alcohol wash: submerge and agitate; count mites vs bees. Sugar roll: dust, roll, and shake out; return live bees. CO₂: anesthetise briefly and separate mites. Record % infestation and repeat at set calendar points. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Seasonality & Climate
Sample in spring build-up, post-spring flow, post-harvest, and pre-winter. In continuous-brood climates, add mid-season checks. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
