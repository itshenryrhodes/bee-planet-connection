## Types & Variants
Contact feeders (jar/tub with perforated lid), frame feeders inside the brood box, top feeders above the crownboard, and entrance/boardman feeders (higher robbing risk). Fondant/candy boards for cold periods.

## Using It Well
Reduce robbing by feeding internally and at dusk; seal gaps; avoid spillage. In winter, fondant directly above the cluster saves lives. Clean and store feeders dry between seasons.

## Costs & Practicalities
Frame and top feeders cost more but reduce robbing; contact feeders are cheap and flexible; entrance feeders are convenient but risky in dearth.

## Recent Innovations
Insulated tops with integrated feeders, slow-release valve lids, and clearer sight-windows to judge fill levels without disturbance.
