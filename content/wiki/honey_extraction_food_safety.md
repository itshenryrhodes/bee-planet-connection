# Honey extraction food safety

## What It Is
Extraction separates honey from comb while preserving aroma, enzymes, and identity. Food-grade handling and documentation underpin quality and customer trust.

## Harvesting & Processing
Pull capped supers, clear bees humanely, and move to a clean, low-humidity room. Uncap cleanly, extract with balanced frames, coarse-filter, allow air/foam to rise, and settle before jarring. Keep equipment sanitised and segregate batches with clear lot codes.

## Properties & Uses
Viscosity and flavour vary by floral source and temperature. Gentle warming for bottling is acceptable; avoid prolonged high heat that elevates HMF or dulls aroma.

## Market & Value
Retail buyers expect clear labels (origin, weight, lot/date) and clean presentation; trade buyers may require moisture/HMF specs. Traceability enables recalls and repeatability.

## Further Reading & Sources
Check food hygiene regulations, recognised honey composition/labelling standards, and local registration requirements for food businesses. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
