# Honey room layout hygiene

## What It Is
A dedicated, food-safe extraction area with cleanable surfaces, controlled temperature/humidity, and one-way workflow that minimises cross-contamination.

## Harvesting & Processing
Organise zones: ‘sticky’ intake, uncapping/extraction, settling/filtration, and jarring/boxing. Keep floors non-slip and washable; position hand-wash and tool sinks; use insect-proof intake and screened vents. Maintain batch logs and cleaning SOPs.

## Properties & Uses
Stable, cool, low-humidity rooms protect aroma and reduce moisture pickup. Good lighting improves capping quality and cleanliness.

## Market & Value
Retail and wholesale buyers value hygienic, traceable production; clean rooms reduce rejects and rework.
