# Honey authenticity adulteration

## What It Is
Authenticity covers floral source, geographic origin, and purity (no added sugars). Adulteration includes dilution with syrups or mislabelling of origin.

## Harvesting & Processing
Transparent handling, batch coding, and careful blending protect integrity. Avoid overheating which can degrade quality markers.

## Properties & Uses
Monofloral honeys show distinct pollen and chemistry profiles. Consumers value provenance, raw handling, and traceability.

## Market & Value
Premiums depend on verified origin and lab tests. Keep documentation for each batch to pass audits and assure buyers.
