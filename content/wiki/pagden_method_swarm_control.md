## Step-by-Step
Find the queen and place her with one or two frames of eggs/young larvae plus food in a new box on the original stand. Move the old brood box with swarm cells a few metres aside; leave one good cell. Flying bees return to the new box with the queen, reducing pressure. After 7â€“10 days, check for extra cells and ensure space on both units. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
