# Queen marking clipping

## At-a-Glance
Marking queens improves inspection speed and accuracy; optional wing clipping helps manage swarming. Done carefully, both are low-risk tasks that pay dividends during peak season.

## Why it Matters
Finding the queen quickly speeds diagnostics (e.g., confirming queen-rightness) and reduces rough handling of frames. Clipping can prevent prime swarms from flying far, buying time to intervene.

## Step-by-Step
Gently confine the queen in a marking tube or under a crown-of-thorns cage. Apply a small dot of the year’s colour paint to the thorax; let dry before release. For clipping, remove a small portion of a forewing with fine scissors—steady hands and minimal restraint are key. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Common Pitfalls
Over-painting (glueing wings/legs), clipping both forewings, or losing the queen by handling frames over grass. Work above the hive, keep equipment to hand, and practise with drones.
