# Demaree method swarm control

## At-a-Glance
The Demaree method reduces swarming by separating the queen from most brood while maintaining a strong foraging force in one stack. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Why it Matters
Unlike simple splits, Demaree retains nectar-gathering strength for the main flow while removing the triggers that drive swarm impulse. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Step-by-Step
Place the queen with one frame of emerging brood and eggs in the bottom box with foundation/space; put remaining brood in an upper box separated by a queen excluder (and often a super). Ensure ample space above for brood to emerge and for nectar processing. Break down any queen cells in the upper box after 7â€“10 days; repeat checks as needed.
