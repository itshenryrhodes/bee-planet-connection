# Bearding overheating swarm triage

## At-a-Glance
Large clumps of bees on the hive front (bearding) can signal heat regulation, inadequate ventilation, or imminent swarming. Distinguish quickly and respond appropriately.

## Why it Matters
Misdiagnosis leads to either pointless disturbance or missed swarm interventions. Correct triage protects brood, yield, and neighbour relations. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Step-by-Step
Check ventilation and water first; add shade/airflow if hives are hot. Inspect brood nest for charged queen cells and backfilling. If cells are present, use swarm control (Demaree/Pagden). If no cells and supers are light, add space. Recheck within 48 hours. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Seasonality & Climate
Bearding peaks on hot, still evenings during sustained flows. True swarm prep clusters persist despite improved airflow and often appear earlier in the day. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
