# Hygienic behavior stock selection

## At-a-Glance
Selecting for hygienic behaviour (rapid detection and removal of diseased/infested brood) improves disease resilience and reduces reliance on treatments over time.

## Why it Matters
Colonies with strong hygienic traits limit brood disease spread and may show lower varroa reproduction, creating a foundation for sustainable beekeeping. Additional practical detail forthcoming.

## Step-by-Step
Source queens from breeders who test for hygienic traits; evaluate your colonies using pin-kill or freeze-kill brood assays; requeen from top performers; keep simple performance logs (temperament, overwintering, honey yield) to balance traits.
