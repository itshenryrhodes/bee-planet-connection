# Beeswax candle making basics

## What It Is
Beeswax candles offer bright, drip-resistant flames with natural aroma when wick size and wax prep are right.

## Harvesting & Processing
Filter wax progressively; avoid overheating that darkens and reduces viscosity. Choose wick size/ply for mould diameter; test-burn samples before production. Add nothing or only approved colourants; label accordingly.

## Properties & Uses
Beeswax has a higher melting point than many waxes; correct wick sizing prevents tunnelling or sooting. Moulded vs dipped candles need different cooling routines to avoid cracks.

## Market & Value
Premium artisanal productâ€”appearance, scent, and clean burn drive repeat sales. Provide burn-time guidance and safety labels.
