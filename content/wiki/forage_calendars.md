## Drivers & Mechanisms
UK flows: spring OSR and orchard bloom; main summer clover/lime/bramble; late summer heather in some regions; ivy into autumn. Mediterranean flows start earlier, with spring herbs and citrus, summer sunflowers/lavenders, and mid-summer dearths in hot/dry areas.

## Impacts & Case Studies
Mismatches between hive strength and flows cost honey and stress colonies. Align supering and swarm control with local calendars.

## Mitigation & Best Practice
Use local bloom diaries, plant staggered forage, and avoid harvesting suspect nectars (e.g., toxic rhododendron). Feed only to bridge genuine gaps, not during good flows.
