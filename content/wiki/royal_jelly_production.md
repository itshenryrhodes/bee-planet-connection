# Royal jelly production

## What It Is
Royal jelly is a protein-rich secretion used to feed queen larvae. It is harvested from grafted cells before sealing and requires strict hygiene.

## Harvesting & Processing
Prepare strong cell starters/finishers; graft very young larvae into cups; harvest jelly at ~68–72 hours before capping. Work cold/clean; filter and chill/freeze promptly to preserve quality.

## Properties & Uses
Composition varies with diet and colony; freshness and cold chain drive quality. Sold fresh/frozen or lyophilised for supplements in some markets—check local rules.

## Market & Value
Labour-intensive with niche demand; premiums depend on verified freshness and provenance. Scale with dedicated starters and disciplined workflow.
