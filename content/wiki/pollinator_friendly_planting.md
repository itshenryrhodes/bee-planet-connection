## Drivers & Mechanisms
Staggered flowering reduces dearths; better spray timing prevents harm; nesting habitat and water complete the picture.

## Impacts & Case Studies
Urban verges, farm flower strips, and mixed hedgerows increase pollinator abundance and can lift fruit set and seed quality.

## Mitigation & Best Practice
Plan seasonal palettes (early willow/fruit; mid clovers/lavenders; late ivy/sedum). Prefer local natives; reduce mowing; provide water and nesting sites; coordinate with neighbours and councils.

## Further Reading & Sources
Use recognised pollinator plant lists and local extension guidance to tailor mixes. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming. Additional practical detail forthcoming.
