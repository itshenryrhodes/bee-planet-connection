> **At a Glance:** Pair simple sensory with basic records to support monofloral claims—or label as ‘predominantly from’ with honesty.

## Why it Matters
- Prevents over-claiming; preserves trust and price.
- Improves tasting and storytelling skills.

## Objectives
- Create a sensory sheet (aroma, flavour, texture, colour).
- Link harvest dates/sites to known blooms.
- Decide when to send to lab or avoid claim.

## What Good Looks Like
- Blind-coded tastings; two-person notes; photo of frame/comb colour.
- Calendar mapping of dominant bloom windows per yard.
- Cautious labels when overlap is likely.

## Step-by-Step
1) Shortlist likely monoflorals per region and window.
2) Taste with reference jars; record descriptors and colour scale.
3) Compare to bloom/scale notes; check moisture/conductivity if available.
4) For premium claims, send lab sample; file certificate.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Odd seasons blend flows—downgrade claim if in doubt.
- Late ivy blends common—separate tanks early.

## Data & Thresholds
- Internal rule: no ‘monofloral’ without supporting evidence.
- Keep 1 jar retain per candidate batch.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Customer dispute -> Provide batch notes; offer lab cert for premium lines.
- Inconsistent descriptors -> Re-run blind with palate reset.
- Lab result borderline -> Use ‘predominantly from’ phrasing.

## Common Pitfalls
- Relying on memory and romantic stories.
- No retains for later comparison.
- Confusing colour changes with varietal certainty.

## Tools & Techniques
- Tasting cards, colour guides, reference set, conductivity/moisture meters.
- Simple photo station to keep colour consistent.

## Safety & Compliance
- Avoid medicinal claims; follow legal naming.
- Keep certificates organised for buyers.

## Field Checklist
- Sensory sheets printed.
- Reference jars available.
- Retains stored and labelled.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain natural variation; avoid absolutes.
