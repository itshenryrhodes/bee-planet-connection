> **At a Glance:** Propolis is the colony’s immune wallpaper. Managing propolis flow improves hive hygiene, reduces draft, and can support beneficial microbiota while adding a marketable byproduct.

## Why it Matters
- Propolis seals gaps, lowers pathogen loads, and stabilises hive climate.
- Clean collection creates an extra revenue stream.
- Thoughtful propolis promotion can reduce reliance on some treatments.

## Objectives
- Encourage moderate propolising where climate benefits from sealing.
- Collect propolis cleanly with screens without contaminating wax or honey.
- Store and process propolis safely for tinctures or raw sale.

## What Good Looks Like
- Propolis mats installed seasonally; clean, resin-rich scrapings.
- Drafts reduced, crown board seams sealed, less burr comb chaos.
- Batch logs for collected propolis with dates and yard tags.

## Step-by-Step
1) Fit propolis screens where climate benefits (late summer–autumn).
2) Chill or freeze mats to crack and collect clean propolis.
3) Sieve debris; store cool and dark in sealed food-safe bags.
4) For tinctures: follow food-safe alcohol extraction guidance; label strength and batch.
5) Balance: avoid over-sealing that impedes inspections; trim carefully.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Warm periods increase resin gathering; drought may shift plant sources.
- Cold snaps make propolis brittle and easier to collect.

## Data & Thresholds
- Collection cadence: check mats every 2–4 weeks in season.
- Avoid over-harvest that strips bees’ sealing capacity before winter.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Excessive propolis making boxes immovable -> Lightly ease seals with hive tool; reduce mat exposure next cycle.
- Symptom: Drafts and condensation -> Encourage propolis by adding rougher surfaces/laths; check ventilation balance.
- Symptom: Dirty propolis batches -> Improve mat cleanliness and storage workflow.

## Common Pitfalls
- Scraping dirty propolis from floor debris and mixing batches.
- Over-promoting propolising so inspections become destructive.
- Using non-food-safe solvents for extraction.

## Tools & Techniques
- Propolis screens/mats, scrapers, freezer for clean separation.
- Fine sieves, food-safe alcohol for tinctures where allowed.

## Safety & Compliance
- Follow local regulations on propolis products and claims.
- Label solvent percentages and provide batch traceability.

## Field Checklist
- Mats fitted and dated.
- Batches bagged, labelled, and stored correctly.
- Ventilation and drafts reviewed.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain benefits of propolis to site owners concerned about hive ‘glue’.

## Notes
A rough top bar or propolis trap frame can gently encourage collection without chaos.
