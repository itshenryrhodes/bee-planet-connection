> **At a Glance:** Short, tidy tastings sell jars fast. Keep samples safe, scripts simple, and data captured.

## Why it Matters
- Drives trial and repeat sales at stockists.
- Strengthens retailer relationships.

## Objectives
- Standardise tasting kit and hygiene.
- Draft 30-second script and FAQs.
- Capture sign-ups or retailer reorder signals.

## What Good Looks Like
- Two varietals + one special; small spoons/lids; bin with lid.
- Placard: allergen info, price, ‘where to find me in store’.
- QR for newsletter; stockist order pad.

## Step-by-Step
1) Book slot; confirm power/table; send insurance/RA.
2) Pack kit: jars, tasters, cloths, bin, signage, QR.
3) Deliver script; handle objections; note feedback.
4) Record sales uplift; send thanks; schedule next.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Christmas Q4; spring launch windows strong.
- Heat—keep jars cool; swap spoons frequently.

## Data & Thresholds
- Target conversion rate per hour.
- Reorder trigger with buyer post-demo.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Low uptake -> Move position; bigger sign; sweeter varietal first.
- Mess -> Reduce portion size; change spoons; wipe every 5 min.
- No reorder -> Offer bundle; date next promo.

## Common Pitfalls
- No prices visible.
- Too many SKUs on table.
- No follow-up with buyer.

## Tools & Techniques
- Clipboards, QR codes, sample jars with restrictors.
- Branded table runner and photo props.

## Safety & Compliance
- Allergen placard; sampling hygiene.
- Venue rules and insurance.

## Field Checklist
- Kit packed; placards printed.
- Samples prepped; bin ready.
- Thanks email scheduled.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Invite customers to share tasting notes.
