> **At a Glance:** Action thresholds translate mite counts into clear treatment decisions.

## Why it Matters
- Prevents over-treating or missing critical windows.
- Standardises decisions across yards and seasons.

## Step-by-Step
1) Choose a sampling method (alcohol wash preferred for accuracy).
2) Sample at least 300 bees; calculate mites per 100 bees.
3) Compare to seasonal thresholds (spring <2/100, summer <3/100, autumn <1/100 before wintering â€” adjust to local guidance).
4) If above threshold, select an appropriate treatment and re-check efficacy.

## Data & Thresholds
- Per-100 bees metric supports comparison.
- Lower thresholds pre-winter to protect long-lived bees.

## Common Pitfalls
- Using sticky boards alone for thresholds
- Tiny sample sizes

## Further Reading
- National guidance on seasonal action levels
