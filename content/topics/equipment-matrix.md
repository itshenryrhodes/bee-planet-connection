> **At a Glance:** A simple matrix lists what boxes, frames, and tools you own, where they are, and their condition—ending ‘where is that?’ panic.

## Why it Matters
- Saves time and duplicate purchases.
- Supports maintenance planning and batch traceability.

## Objectives
- Create an equipment register by site and condition.
- Track consumables and reorder triggers.
- Plan renewals and standardise SKUs.

## What Good Looks Like
- Spreadsheet/app with counts, sizes, locations, condition, next actions.
- Standardised frame type and box sizes to reduce chaos.
- Colour tags for repair/scrap decisions.

## Step-by-Step
1) Inventory: walk each site and store; count and rate.
2) Standardise: choose frame sizes and box types; deprecate oddities.
3) Reorder levels: set min/max for frames, foundation, lids.
4) Review quarterly; tie into season plan (splits/supers).

## Seasonality & Climate
- Pre-spring build and post-harvest reviews catch shortages.
- Weather losses feed back into reorder levels.

## Data & Thresholds
- Red/amber/green status per item.
- Trigger levels for automatic reorder.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Last-minute shortages -> Raise mins; add calendar reminders.
- Symptom: Piles of broken gear -> Scrap rule; repair day scheduled.
- Symptom: Mixed frame types -> Standardise and sell off surplus.

## Common Pitfalls
- No owner for the register.
- Mixing foundation/frame types across yards.

## Tools & Techniques
- Shared sheet/app; QR tags; simple codes on boxes.
- Annual ‘repair day’ with parts kits.

## Safety & Compliance
- Store gear dry and safe from rodents.
- Log repairs that affect food contact surfaces.

## Field Checklist
- Register updated.
- Mins met before spring.
- Broken items tagged.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Publish a one-page ‘our SKUs’ for volunteers.

## Further Reading
- Smallholding equipment inventory templates.
- Lean stock control primers.
