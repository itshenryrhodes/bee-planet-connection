> **At a Glance:** Used boxes and frames can carry brood disease spores for years. Buy only with provenance and decontaminate thoroughly before use.

## Why it Matters
AFB spores persist on wood and hardware; contaminated gear can reseed disease across apiaries and void insurance.

## Step-by-Step
Avoid purchasing old brood comb; render/destroy suspect frames. Scrape, flame, or chemically sterilise woodenware per local guidance. Replace foundation. Keep second-hand gear quarantined until inspected under load. Record source and sanitising method.

## Seasonality & Climate
Do major sterilisation in the off-season so cleaned gear is ready for spring; dry weather aids curing and storage.

## Common Pitfalls
Trusting ‘looks clean’ without sterilisation, reusing brood comb, and mixing unsterilised kit across yards.
