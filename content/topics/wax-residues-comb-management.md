> **At a Glance:** Residue-aware comb management protects product quality and bee health.

## Why it Matters
- Reduces contamination risk in honey and wax products.
- Supports certification and market access.

## Step-by-Step
1) Track treatments by batch and date per hive.
2) Rotate out old brood comb regularly (e.g., 3-year cycle).
3) Use dedicated 'food-grade' supers with no recent treatments.
4) Render old comb separately and label outputs.

## Common Pitfalls
- No comb rotation plan
- Mixing treated brood comb with honey supers
