> **At a Glance:** Reliable, attractive water sources keep bees off neighbours' taps and pools.

## Why it Matters
- Reduces complaints and dehydration stress.
- Supports brood rearing and cooling.

## Step-by-Step
1) Provide textured landing and shallow gradients.
2) Add mineral hint (e.g., a pinch of salt) to encourage use.
3) Place upwind and sun-warmed early season.
4) Maintain through drought; prevent algae with refresh cycles.

## Common Pitfalls
- Deep containers without floats
- Letting sources run dry
