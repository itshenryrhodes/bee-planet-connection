> **At a Glance:** Pagden mimics an artificial swarm by moving the queen and flyers away from the brood—simple, reliable if done promptly.

## Why it Matters
- Stops imminent swarms with minimal kit.
- Allows controlled queen replacement if desired.

## Objectives
- Create a queenright ‘artificial swarm’ on original stand.
- Leave queen cells to requeen the brood hive, or introduce a queen.
- Prevent drifts/robbing and keep flow productivity.

## What Good Looks Like
- Original stand: new box with queen + flyers + some comb; no cells.
- Old brood box moved aside: selected open queen cell(s) only.
- Follow-up to reduce cells to one and confirm emergence/mating.

## Step-by-Step
1) Find queen; place her with a few brood frames and foundation in a new box on original stand.
2) Move the old brood box 1–2 m away; shake off flyers from frame tops back to queenright box.
3) In brood box, reduce to best open queen cell; destroy others.
4) Follow-up at day 7 and day 14: remove extras; confirm emergence.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Peak spring through early summer.
- Poor mating weather requires backup queen plans.

## Data & Thresholds
- Trigger: charged swarm cells.
- Mating window checks ~3–4 weeks to laying.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Multiple cells again -> Cull to one; re-check in 7 days.
- Failed mating -> Introduce mated queen or unite.
- Weak queenright half -> Add frames of emerging brood.

## Common Pitfalls
- Leaving multiple cells—casts risk.
- Forgetting to return flyers to queenright box.
- Not feeding small queenright half in dearth.

## Tools & Techniques
- Spare brood box, stand, foundation, frame cage, feeder as needed.
- Frame marker and diary.

## Safety & Compliance
- Lift with care; mark moved hives to deter public approach.
- Record queen lineage and changes.

## Field Checklist
- Queen confirmed in new box.
- Brood box reduced to one QC.
- Follow-up dates set.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain ‘flyers home to queen’ principle to trainees.

## Further Reading
- Pagden diagrams and timing charts.
- Artificial swarm variations.

## Notes
Mark the chosen queen cell with a pin—faster checks on follow-ups.
