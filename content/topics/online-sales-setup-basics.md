> **At a Glance:** Simple webshop beats fancy: clean product pages, easy shipping, clear returns, and fresh photos.

## Why it Matters
- Diversifies sales beyond markets.
- Lets press and social traffic convert any time.

## Objectives
- Choose a platform and payment provider.
- Write clear product pages with batch/weight/BBE info.
- Set shipping/returns policy and packing SOP.

## What Good Looks Like
- Home: bestsellers + story; PDP: photos, ingredients, origin.
- Checkout: few steps; guest checkout on.
- Order picking: batch trace and packing slips.

## Step-by-Step
1) Pick platform; set tax, shipping zones, weights.
2) Load products: photos, variants, barcodes; test checkout.
3) Write policies; add contact and returns page.
4) Integrate email sign-up; test order → pack → dispatch.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Q4 surge—prep stock, boxes, labels.
- Heat—insulate combo packs (candles/choc).

## Data & Thresholds
- Conversion rate and abandoned cart baseline.
- Pack/dispatch SLA (e.g., 2 business days).

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- High abandon -> Shipping shock; show costs earlier.
- Low conversion -> Weak photos/copy; simplify pages.
- Returns spike -> Clarify weight/size; improve packing.

## Common Pitfalls
- Hidden shipping; no returns info.
- No batch code in order record.
- Out-of-date photos and RRPs.

## Tools & Techniques
- Label printer, scales, packing bench checklist.
- UTM + analytics to track campaigns.

## Safety & Compliance
- Legal labels online; privacy and cookies notice.
- Accurate weights and allergen info.

## Field Checklist
- Test order placed.
- Packing SOP posted.
- Returns address visible.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Send order follow-ups with care tips and where to buy locally.
