> **At a Glance:** If you trap pollen, dry it quickly, clean it well, and store cold. Moisture and hygiene make or break quality.

## Why it Matters
- Spoilage and contaminants are common risks.
- Quality determines value and safety.

## Objectives
- Set moisture targets and drying times.
- Adopt a cleaning and sieving protocol.
- Package and freeze with batch traceability.

## What Good Looks Like
- Drying to safe moisture then sealed and frozen.
- Foreign matter removed; pollen colour preserved.
- Labels: date, yard, trap ID, batch weight.

## Step-by-Step
1) Collect daily; chill promptly; clean debris and bees.
2) Dry with gentle warm air (<45 °C target) to safe moisture.
3) Sieve/inspect; package; freeze or store cold/dry.
4) Record batch data; clean traps before re-hanging.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Humid weather extends drying time.
- Heat waves risk colour/volatile loss—keep temps low.

## Data & Thresholds
- Moisture target (specify % per guidance); sample per batch.
- Foreign matter limits and visual checks.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Mould -> Dry faster/cooler; improve trap hygiene.
- Off-odours -> Overheating; reduce temp/time.
- Insects -> Better sealing/freezing; clean room controls.

## Common Pitfalls
- Leaving traps on during dearth—robbing and stress.
- Overheating that cooks flavour.
- Weak batch records.

## Tools & Techniques
- Food dehydrator/air rack, moisture checks, fine sieves.
- Cold storage and clean benches.

## Safety & Compliance
- Food hygiene standards; allergen handling.
- Accurate labels and batch codes.

## Field Checklist
- Daily harvest plan.
- Drying logs complete.
- Batches labelled and stored.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain to helpers why ‘low and slow’ protects quality.

## Notes
Trap lightly—long trapping weakens colonies; schedule rest weeks.
