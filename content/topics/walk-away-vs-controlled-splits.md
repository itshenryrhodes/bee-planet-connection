> **At a Glance:** Controlled splits beat walk-away splits for predictable outcomes and timing.

## Why it Matters
- Shortens brood break and restores productivity faster.
- Improves queen quality through planned cell/queen use.

## Step-by-Step
1) Assess donor strength and resources.
2) Controlled: add ripe queen cell or mated queen; Walk-away: rely on emergency cells.
3) Feed if scant nectar; ensure adequate nurse bees.
4) Verify laying pattern after 2–3 weeks (controlled) or 3–4 weeks (walk-away).

## Common Pitfalls
- Under-resourcing the split
- No follow-up confirmation of queenrightness
