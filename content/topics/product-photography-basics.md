> **At a Glance:** Natural light, simple backgrounds, and consistent angles beat expensive kit. Shoot, then batch-edit for speed.

## Why it Matters
- Great photos raise conversion and wholesale interest.
- Consistency simplifies web and label updates.

## Objectives
- Create a mini style guide (angles, backdrop, props).
- Shoot a base set for each SKU and season.
- Batch-edit and file with predictable names.

## What Good Looks Like
- Window light 45°, white foam-board bounce, tripod/phone stand.
- Hero, straight-on, back label, in-hand, in-context (food/forage).
- Folder: /photos/<year>/<sku> with edit presets.

## Step-by-Step
1) Draft style guide; pick backdrop (matte, non-reflective).
2) Clean jars; de-dust labels; set tripod; level.
3) Shoot sequence per SKU; include batch/BBE close-up.
4) Edit batch (exposure, crop), export web + print sizes.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Avoid harsh midday sun; diffuse with sheer fabric.
- Winter = longer shutter; use stand/remote to avoid blur.

## Data & Thresholds
- Keep white balance consistent across SKUs.
- Minimum 2000px longest side for web; 300dpi for print.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Glare on glass -> Shift angle; use polariser; darker backdrop.
- Label warp -> Re-jar sample or warm label to relax bubbles.
- Colour cast -> Set custom white balance; fix in batch edit.

## Common Pitfalls
- Busy props distracting from label.
- Mixed light sources (blue/yellow).
- No back/ingredient shot for retailers.

## Tools & Techniques
- Phone + stand, foam boards, polariser, light tent optional.
- Editing presets and file naming convention.

## Safety & Compliance
- Accurate labels visible; no misleading serving images.
- Permission for recognisable people/venues.

## Field Checklist
- Glass spotless; labels straight.
- Angles matched to style guide.
- Exports in web/print folders.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Tell the flower/forage story in captions.

## Further Reading
- Phone product photography primers.
- Light tent and polariser guides.
