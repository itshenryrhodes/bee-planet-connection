      <h2>Honey Authenticity Guide: How to Spot the Real Thing</h2>
      <p><em>Published: 23 September 2025</em></p>

      <p>We’ve all been there – standing in front of the supermarket shelf, staring at row upon row of golden jars. But how do you know what’s genuine honey and what’s been cut with syrups or sweeteners? With reports of honey fraud still surfacing in 2025, it’s worth brushing up on a few simple checks.</p>

      <h3>Why authenticity matters</h3>
      <p>Fake honey undermines beekeepers, hurts biodiversity, and leaves consumers short-changed. Worse still, adulterated honey can distort global markets, driving down prices and making it harder for honest producers to survive.</p>

      <h3>How to test your honey at home</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The spoon test:</strong> Real honey drizzles slowly and steadily, while adulterated honey often runs too thin.</li>
        <li><strong>The water test:</strong> A spoonful of real honey will sink and clump at the bottom of a glass of water before dissolving. Syrup blends spread quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>The thumb test:</strong> Place a small drop on your thumb – if it spreads or runs off, it’s likely not pure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Latest research</h3>
      <p>According to the International Bee Research Association, advanced NMR testing and pollen analysis are now being used globally to verify honey authenticity. These tools help regulators and trade groups weed out fraudulent shipments before they reach the shelves.</p>

      <h3>What you can do</h3>
      <p>When possible, buy from trusted local beekeepers, farmers’ markets, or cooperatives. If you’re shopping online or in supermarkets, check the label carefully – origin transparency is a good sign.</p>

      <p>Supporting genuine honey producers not only protects your health, but also ensures bees and ecosystems continue to thrive.</p>
