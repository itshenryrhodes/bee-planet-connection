      <h2>Colony losses: what the latest research is (really) saying</h2>
      <time datetime="2025-09-23">Published: Tue 23 Sep 2025</time>

      <p>
        Every beekeeper knows the sinking feeling of opening a hive in spring and finding it silent. 
        Colony loss is nothing new – but the scale and drivers have been shifting in ways that are 
        important for both hobbyists and commercial operations to understand.
      </p>

      <h3>The numbers</h3>
      <p>
        Surveys from Europe and North America suggest that <strong>winter losses in 2024–25 ran at 
        around 15–20%</strong>, broadly in line with the long-term average. But what raised eyebrows 
        this year was the <strong>uptick in summer losses</strong> – often attributed to forage gaps, 
        heat stress and pesticide exposure. In some regions, reported combined annual losses were 
        edging towards 35%.
      </p>

      <h3>Key drivers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Varroa destructor</strong> – still the number one stressor, with resistance to common treatments making management harder.</li>
        <li><strong>Forage and nutrition</strong> – patchy nectar flows and late frosts reduced key spring resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather extremes</strong> – hotter, drier summers stressed colonies and shortened flowering windows.</li>
        <li><strong>Pesticide exposure</strong> – sublethal doses continue to be implicated in reduced resilience.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What you can do</h3>
      <p>
        Research isn’t all doom and gloom. Practical steps can make a measurable difference:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rotate and combine varroa treatments to reduce resistance build-up.</li>
        <li>Plant or support <em>continuous forage</em> sources near your apiary – clover, borage, late ivy.</li>
        <li>Ensure adequate shade and ventilation in hot spells.</li>
        <li>Work with local farmer networks to share best practice around spray times and bee-safe treatments.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why this matters</h3>
      <p>
        Bees aren’t just a hobby – they’re linchpins in our food system. Understanding colony loss trends 
        helps us keep bees resilient, maintain pollination services, and support a sustainable apiculture sector. 
        The science is clear: awareness plus action equals stronger bees.
