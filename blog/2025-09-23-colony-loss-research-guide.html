      <p>Colony losses are never just “one thing”. COLOSS surveys and partner studies keep pointing to a familiar gang: <strong>varroa and viruses</strong>, <strong>queen issues</strong>, <strong>nutrition gaps</strong>, and <strong>weather/forage swings</strong>. The good news? There’s loads you can do — and most of it is simple, planned, and repeatable.</p>

      <h2>Four big drivers (in plain English)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Varroa + viruses:</strong> If mites run the show, viruses do the damage. Monitor, rotate treatments, and don’t leave “just one more week”.</li>
        <li><strong>Queens:</strong> Failing or poorly mated queens mean dwindly colonies. Know your queen’s age, have a spare plan, and requeen before it’s a drama.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Sparse forage or long nectar gaps knock brood rearing. Think pollen, think timing, and keep an eye on stores.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather & forage:</strong> Hot dry spring? Rain-lashed summer? Expect odd flows and be ready to adapt inspections and feeding.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Three quick wins for hobbyists</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Make varroa visible:</strong> Sugar roll or alcohol wash as standard — pop it in your diary. Treat to thresholds, not vibes.</li>
        <li><strong>Track your queens:</strong> A simple card or app noting age, temperament, and brood pattern helps you act early.</li>
        <li><strong>Feed with intent:</strong> If forage is patchy, top up — and don’t ignore protein. A tiny nudge at the right time beats a big rescue later.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>And three for commercial operators</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Standardise mite management:</strong> Apiary-level monitoring, rotation across seasons, and resistance-aware choices.</li>
        <li><strong>Queen pipeline:</strong> Line-bred stock, clear replacement windows, and nucleus capacity to swap fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Data > guesswork:</strong> Weather + yield + disease logs. Spot patterns, move early, reduce losses.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>What to watch next</h2>
      <p>COLOSS will keep publishing multi-country results — useful for spotting regional patterns and odd seasons. Pair that with your own notes and you’ll get a feel for when to feed, split, or sit tight.</p>
