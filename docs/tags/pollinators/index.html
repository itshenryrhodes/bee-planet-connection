This piece is my line in the sand and a statement for what I stand for at Bee Planet Connection. Bee Planet Connection will challenge orthodoxies, cheer on good practice, and call out the lazy myths that keep us stuck. Think Sunday paper essay meets a straight-talking op-ed. Let’s talk about why bees - honeybees and their wild cousins - still sit at the centre of a global story about food, culture, climate, and what we value. And yes, we’ll be upfront about honey - celebrating it while also being honest about the trade-offs and ethics that come with loving something we take from.</p></p></li></ul><p><a href=https://www.beeplanetconnection.org/categories/>All categories</a> · <a href=https://www.beeplanetconnection.org/blog/>Back to Blog</a></p></main></body></html>
