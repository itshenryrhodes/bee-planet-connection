> **At a Glance:** Ivy is a powerful late flow in many regions—great for winter stores but can set hard. Manage space, moisture, and timing.

## Why it Matters
- Builds winter stores and brood food.
- Prevents solid bricks of ivy honey blocking spring build.

## Objectives
- Stage supers or space for ivy intake where desired.
- Control moisture and extraction timing if jarring ivy honey.
- Plan spring comb management to avoid brood lock.

## What Good Looks Like
- Healthy colonies with space and ventilation during ivy bloom.
- Moisture monitored; extraction or leave for stores decided early.
- Spring: rotate or remove ivy-bound combs strategically.

## Step-by-Step
1) Watch scale upturn and pollen loads; add space if needed.
2) Decide: harvest a portion or leave all as stores.
3) For harvest: pull early; dry to ≤18% if needed; jar with notes.
4) Spring: swap out hard ivy frames; provide fresh comb.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Blooms late autumn; cold snaps halt flows fast.
- Humid spells raise moisture—use warm, dry room if extracting.

## Data & Thresholds
- Target moisture ≤18%; track weight change per day.
- Spring brood space target by frame count.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Backfilling brood late -> Add space; consider feeding earlier in autumn instead of chasing ivy.
- Symptom: Fermentation risk -> Dry or blend; do not jar wet.
- Symptom: Spring slow -> Remove ivy bricks; add drawn comb.

## Common Pitfalls
- Leaving wet ivy to ferment in cool rooms.
- No spring plan for hard-set combs.

## Tools & Techniques
- Scales, refractometer, warm dry room, comb rotation plan.
- Sharp knives for spring removal of solid sections.

## Safety & Compliance
- Food safety in late-season extraction rooms.
- Lifting care in cold, damp conditions.

## Field Checklist
- Space and ventilation set.
- Moisture checked before jarring.
- Spring comb plan noted.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain flavour and texture expectations to customers.
