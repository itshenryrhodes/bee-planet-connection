> **At a Glance:** Select for bees that detect and remove diseased/infested brood quickly—hygiene lowers chemical pressure over time.

## Why it Matters
- Improves colony health and survivorship.
- Supports integrated varroa and disease management.

## Objectives
- Adopt a simple field test protocol for hygiene.
- Track queen lineage vs outcomes.
- Propagate from top performers; cull poor lines.

## What Good Looks Like
- Standardised tests (pin/freeze kill) with % removal at 24 h.
- Trait cards per queen with temperament, productivity, hygiene.
- Breeding from top quartile only.

## Step-by-Step
1) Choose method (freeze kill common) and season window.
2) Test multiple colonies; record removal % and conditions.
3) Tag breeder queens; raise/introduce daughters; track results.
4) Review annually; replace laggards.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Warm stable weather reduces test variance.
- Avoid major flows or dearth extremes.

## Data & Thresholds
- Removal % targets (e.g., ≥95% in 24 h for top stock).
- Temperament and productivity floors to avoid single-trait traps.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Great hygiene but hot -> Cross with gentle line; selection index.
- Low hygiene but productive -> Do not breed; requeen from better stock.
- Inconsistent results -> Repeat tests; standardise method.

## Common Pitfalls
- Tiny sample sizes; weather bias.
- Breeding only from honey monsters; ignoring survival traits.
- No records linking daughters to outcomes.

## Tools & Techniques
- Queen tags, freezer/pin tools, trait sheets, simple indices.
- Club collaborations to widen gene pool.

## Safety & Compliance
- Humane test handling; minimise colony stress.
- Transport and marking per local rules.

## Field Checklist
- Test materials ready.
- Breeder candidates identified.
- Records updated post-test.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain that hygiene reduces but does not replace treatments.

## Further Reading
- Hygienic testing protocols.
- Selection index examples.
