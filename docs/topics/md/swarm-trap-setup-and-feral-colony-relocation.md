## Why it Matters
- Prevents unmanaged colonies spreading disease.
- Supports controlled colony expansion.

## Step-by-Step

4) Check weekly during swarm season.

## Common Pitfalls
- Poorly secured traps
- Forgetting regular checks

## Safety & Compliance
Secure traps to prevent accidents in public spaces.
