> **At a Glance:** Heather honey (thixotropic) needs specialised handling—pressing or loosening with agitation before extraction. It rewards careful timing and gear.

## Why it Matters
- High-value crop with unique jelly-like structure.
- Wrong process ruins comb and yield.

## Objectives
- Use prickers or loosening frames before extraction or pressing.
- Maintain warmth and cleanliness to manage viscosity.
- Present heather honey with accurate sensory notes.

## What Good Looks Like
- Frames warmed gently; cappings pricked; press/extractor prepared.
- Clean room and tools; minimal foam; clear batch codes.
- Consistent jars with minimal air bubbles.

## Step-by-Step
1) Warm frames in a controlled room (not hot air blasting).
2) Loosen: use heather prickers/rollers to break gel network.
3) Extract: press or adapted extractor; collect and strain gently.
4) Settle: allow air to rise; skim; jar while warm for flow.
5) Label: varietal, harvest site, and characteristic notes.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Late-summer moorland crop; weather windows tight.
- Transport carefully; avoid chilling that stiffens gel.

## Data & Thresholds
- Room temps typically in mid-20s °C for workable viscosity.
- Moisture checked before and after processing.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Excess bubbles -> Lower agitation; allow longer settle.
- Symptom: Comb collapse -> Lower temperature and gentler handling.
- Symptom: Poor flow -> Increase pricking; consider pressing.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overheating which harms aroma.
- Under-pricking leading to low yields.
- Dirty presses contaminating flavour.

## Tools & Techniques
- Heather prickers/rollers, press or specialised extractor, warming cabinet.
- Fine strainers and settling tanks.

## Safety & Compliance
- Food-safe materials and cleaning between batches.
- Accurate labelling for varietal and weight.

## Field Checklist
- Prickers and press cleaned and ready.
- Warm room set; frames staged.
- Jars and labels prepared.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain thixotropy and mouthfeel to customers.

## Notes
Keep separate tools for heather to avoid cross-flavouring.
