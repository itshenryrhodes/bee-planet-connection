> **At a Glance:** Reduce wasp pressure with strong colonies, small entrances, and yard hygiene.

## Why it Matters
- Late-summer robbing can collapse weak colonies.
- Protects stores and brood.

## Step-by-Step
1) Tighten entrances on weaker hives.
2) Remove exposed feed and sticky waste promptly.
3) Use robbing screens; avoid open feeding in dearth.
4) Cull wasp nests only if legally permitted and necessary.

## Common Pitfalls
- Feeding openly near hives
- Leaving honey gear outside
