> **At a Glance:** Nucs are flexible tools for swarm control, queen rearing, and overwintering insurance. Build strong, well-balanced nucs and manage them deliberately.

## Why it Matters
- Nucs provide spare queens and buffer against losses.
- Well-timed nucs convert swarm pressure into controlled growth.
- Overwintered nucs accelerate spring expansion.

## Objectives
- Assemble nucs with the right ratio of brood, food, bees, and queen.
- Place nucs where drift and robbing are minimised.
- Track growth and promote to full hives at the right time.

## What Good Looks Like
- 5-frame nuc: 2–3 brood frames with adhering bees, 1–2 food frames, and a laying queen or ripe cell.
- Reduced entrance and solid ventilation; placed away from strong colonies.
- Regular checks for queenright status and space needs.

## Step-by-Step
1) Source frames and bees from healthy donor colonies.
2) Provide a mated queen or a protected ripe queen cell.
3) Reduce entrance; feed lightly if forage is thin.
4) Place nuc in separate location to reduce drift; orient distinctly.
5) After 7–10 days, verify laying; add space as needed.
6) Promote to full hive when frames are covered with bees and brood expanding.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Best results in late spring to early summer for mating and build-up.
- Late-season nucs may overwinter with careful feeding and insulation.

## Data & Thresholds
- Acceptance: confirm eggs/larvae by day 7–10 with mated queens.
- Space trigger: >80 percent frame coverage with bees/brood -> add frame/box.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Queenless after cell not emerged -> Add another cell or introduce mated queen.
- Symptom: Robbing -> Reduce entrance further; move; feed internally only.
- Symptom: Stalled growth -> Check nutrition and varroa; add emerging brood.

## Common Pitfalls
- Under-stocked nucs that cannot regulate temperature.
- Introducing unprotected cells crushed by bees.
- Placing nucs adjacent to strong hives causing drift.

## Tools & Techniques
- Nuc boxes with feeders, cell protectors, queen cages.
- Distinct entrance markings, internal feeders, dummy boards.

## Safety & Compliance
- Biosecurity when moving frames between colonies.
- Transport nucs with ventilation and secure straps.

## Field Checklist
- Queen or ripe cell provided.
- Entrance reduced; internal feed ready.
- Follow-up check scheduled (day 7–10).
- Promotion criteria noted.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Label nucs clearly with source colony and date.

## Notes
Maintain a small fleet of nucs year-round as your resilience layer.
