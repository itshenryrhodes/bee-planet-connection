> **At a Glance:** Monitoring methods provide data to trigger timely varroa interventions.

## Why it Matters
- Avoids under- or over-treating.
- Supports integrated pest management.

## Step-by-Step
1) Choose method: alcohol wash, sugar roll, sticky boards.
2) Sample enough bees to ensure reliability.
3) Record and compare against action thresholds.

## Common Pitfalls
- Too few bees sampled
- Not standardising method
