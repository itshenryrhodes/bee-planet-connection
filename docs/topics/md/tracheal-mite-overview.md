> **At a Glance:** Tracheal mites infest bees' breathing tubes, weakening colonies.

## Why it Matters
- Historically serious, though now less common.
- Still a concern in poorly monitored apiaries.

## Step-by-Step
1) Confirm via dissection or lab test.
2) Apply treatments if threshold exceeded.
3) Select resistant stock where available.

## Common Pitfalls
- Confusing symptoms with other stressors
- Not confirming by lab
