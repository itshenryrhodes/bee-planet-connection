> **At a Glance:** Plan for gaps, not just flows. Reduce stress, prevent robbing, and feed smartly to bridge dearths without setting bad habits.

## Why it Matters
- Most losses happen in stress windows, not during flows.
- Robbing and disease spread spike in dearth.

## Objectives
- Map local dearth periods and triggers (heat, mowing, drought).
- Adopt a robbing-prevention SOP (entrances, timing, tidy syrup).
- Use targeted feeding and space management without honey taint.

## What Good Looks Like
- Entrances reduced, wet work done early/late, yards calm.
- Nuc support and feed are measured, not open-ended.
- Comb and space matched to bee numbers; tidy apiaries.

## Step-by-Step
1) Forecast: note last 2–3 years of scale drops and mowing cycles.
2) Tighten: reduce entrances, remove wet combs promptly, close gaps.
3) Support: feed singles/nucs; avoid stimulating swarmy hives.
4) Review weekly: behaviour, mite risk, and stores; adjust.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Heat and wind amplify dearth; shade and water help.
- Storm flushes can create short false ‘mini-flows’—avoid big manipulations right after.

## Data & Thresholds
- Scale loss >0.5–1.0 kg/week triggers SOP.
- Minimum store targets per box; nuc safety floors.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Balling at entrances -> Too open; reduce and add screens.
- Chalkbrood rise -> Ventilation + nutrition; ease inspections.
- Sudden weight drop + high drift -> Robbing; stop wet work; regroup.

## Common Pitfalls
- Leaky feeders triggering fights.
- Leaving sticky equipment exposed.
- Stimulating strong hives that then rob neighbours.

## Tools & Techniques
- Entrance reducers, robber screens, tidy feeder types, wet-comb totes.
- Shade cloth and waterers upwind.

## Safety & Compliance
- Work quiet hours near neighbours.
- Record feed lots for traceability.

## Field Checklist
- Reducers fitted; wet work scheduled.
- Feed/nuc support planned.
- Scale notes logged.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain dearth etiquette to volunteers: tidy, quick, minimal.

## Further Reading
- Regional dearth patterns.

## Notes
Keep one ‘wet-work’ crate with lids—open only at the truck, never by the hives.
