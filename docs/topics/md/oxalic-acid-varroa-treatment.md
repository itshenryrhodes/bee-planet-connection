> **At a Glance:** Oxalic acid works best on broodless colonies. Choose trickle or vaporisation per kit, timing, and legal rules.

## Why it Matters
- High efficacy during brood breaks or winter.
- Low residue risk when used correctly.

## Objectives
- Standardise dose, PPE, and delivery method.
- Schedule for broodless windows where possible.
- Record lots, doses, and outcomes.

## What Good Looks Like
- Broodless timing targeted; correct dose per seam/colony.
- Vapour kit checked; masks and eye protection used.
- Post-treatment counts confirm reduction.

## Step-by-Step
1) Confirm brood status; pick trickle or vapour method.
2) Prepare dose; seal entrances for vapour if required.
3) Apply per label; ventilate; note times and weather.
4) Verify after 3â€“7 days with sampling or drop.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Winter/induced brood breaks are ideal windows.
- Avoid rain/wind for vapour work.

## Data & Thresholds
- Dose per seam or per colony as labelled.
- Expected post-treatment reduction range.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Low effect -> Brood present or poor contact; retime or change method.
- Irritation -> Check dose and temperature; improve ventilation.

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating with heavy brood present.
- Skipping PPE for vapour.
- Confusing grams with millilitres.

## Tools & Techniques
- OA crystals/solution, calibrated syringe/spoon, vapouriser, seal cloths.
- Timer, mask, goggles, gloves.

## Safety & Compliance
- Follow label, PPE, and site safety rules.
- Record treatments for inspections.

## Field Checklist
- Broodless window confirmed.
- Dose prepared; PPE on.
- Follow-up sampling scheduled.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain why broodless timing matters for efficacy.
