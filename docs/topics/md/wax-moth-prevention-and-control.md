> **At a Glance:** Combine freezing, ventilation, and chemical fumigants (where legal) to protect stored comb.

## Why it Matters
- Preserves valuable drawn comb.
- Reduces replacement costs and time.

## Step-by-Step
1) Freeze frames (-18°C, 24–48h) before storage.
2) Store in cool, ventilated stacks with light gaps if safe.
3) Consider acetic acid or approved products per label.
4) Inspect monthly and rotate stacks.

## Common Pitfalls
- Insufficient freezing time
- Storing in warm sheds

## Safety & Compliance
Follow COSHH and label requirements for any fumigants.
