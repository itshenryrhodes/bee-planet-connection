> **At a Glance:** Bearding is a pressure valve, but extreme heat threatens brood viability and comb integrity. Shade, ventilation, and water keep colonies stable through heat spikes.

## Why it Matters
- Brood mortality and queen failure rise in sustained heat without mitigation.
- Comb can slump in thin-walled frames during heat and heavy nectar.
- Public concern increases when large beards form on visible sites.

## Objectives
- Lower internal temperatures without causing drafts.
- Ensure reliable water and shade during peaks.
- Adjust workload and inspections around heat windows.

## What Good Looks Like
- Shade sails or natural shade from midday sun.
- Vent options ready: top vents, screened bottoms used judiciously.
- Water sources maintained within metres of hives.

## Step-by-Step
1) Forecast watch: stage shade and water before the peak.
2) Increase ventilation modestly: prop lids or open small top vent; avoid gales across brood.
3) Add space if crowded to reduce fanning effort and bearding.
4) Shift inspections to early morning or evening with minimal disturbance.
5) After the heat: reset ventilation and check comb and brood health.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Urban sites and rooftops run hotter and hold heat overnight.
- Heat waves may coincide with nectar flows, increasing humidity load.

## Data & Thresholds
- Sustained bearding at mild temps suggests crowding rather than heat.
- If internal temp sensors show >35 Â°C at brood for hours, intervene.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Massive daytime bearding -> Provide shade and water -> Add space -> Check ventilation.
- Symptom: Slumped comb in supers -> Reduce extraction delay; ensure foundation and frame integrity.
- Symptom: Brood patch collapse -> Verify varroa and nutrition; heat may be a compounding factor.

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-ventilating and chilling brood at night after hot days.
- Adding open water without landings, causing drownings.
- Leaving heavy supers on thin comb in extreme heat.

## Tools & Techniques
- Shade sails, windbreak mesh, moisture quilts, screened bottoms.
- Water tubs with floats, extra supers, spacer rims for ventilation.

## Safety & Compliance
- Secure shade gear for wind; avoid trip lines in public spaces.
- Stay hydrated and schedule breaks for keepers.

## Field Checklist
- Shade set, water filled.
- Vent aperture sized to weather.
- Space adequate; supers staged.
- Heat-safe work hours planned.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Brief site owners on visible bearding to avoid concern.

## Further Reading
- Studies on hive microclimate and thermoregulation.
- Urban rooftop beekeeping case studies on heat mitigation.

## Notes
Light-coloured roofs and reflective stands reduce radiant load on rooftop sites.
