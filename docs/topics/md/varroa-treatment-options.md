> **At a Glance:** Rotate treatments and combine biotechnical methods to manage varroa sustainably.

## Why it Matters
- Delays resistance.
- Matches interventions to brood/season conditions.

## Step-by-Step
1) Confirm need via sampling against thresholds.
2) Select from organic acids, essential oils, synthetics, or biotechnical methods.
3) Consider brood status, temperature window, and honey flow.
4) Record batch/lot and re-check mites 7â€“14 days after.

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating during nectar flow against labels
- Repeating same product back-to-back

## Tools & Techniques
- Oxalic acid
- Formic acid
- Thymol
- Amitraz
- Drone brood removal
- Brood breaks
