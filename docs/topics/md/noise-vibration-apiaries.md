> **At a Glance:** Avoid constant vibration and harsh noise near hives. Isolate stands, buffer flight paths, and schedule quiet inspections.

## Why it Matters
- Reduces defensive behaviour and abscond risk.
- Improves queen laying and comb building.

## Objectives
- Identify site vibration/noise sources.
- Install isolation and screens; adjust hours.
- Document neighbour/tenant comms.

## What Good Looks Like
- Rubber isolation pads; level stands; screens against traffic.
- Quiet hours posted; mower/strimmer etiquette agreed.
- Rooftops: anti-vibration mats; route changes to avoid fan blasts.

## Step-by-Step
1) Walk site: note roads, fans, pumps, gates; measure with phone dB app.
2) Isolate stands; add pads; move from resonant decks.
3) Add screens; re-orient entrances; set quiet windows.
4) Review incidents and adjust pathways/equipment.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Summer events and mowing raise noise exposure.
- Storms create banging panels and loose straps.

## Data & Thresholds
- Record baseline dB; note spikes; link to behaviour logs.
- Target: keep regular work <70 dB at the stand when feasible.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Bearding in cool weather -> Vibration stress? Add pads/screens.
- Balling on opening -> Try quieter time; relocate slightly.
- Comb wave in supers -> Check resonance; add cross-bracing.

## Common Pitfalls
- Ignoring vibration on metal decks.
- Working during peak traffic/machine hours.
- Loose lid/strap noise not noticed.

## Tools & Techniques
- Isolation pads, anti-vibration mats, strap tidies.
- Screens/hedges and entrance reducers.

## Safety & Compliance
- Workplace noise rules for rooftop/industrial sites.
- PPE for mowers/strimmers near public.

## Field Checklist
- Pads fitted; straps trimmed.
- Quiet hours agreed.
- Incident log updated.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Share ‘do/don’t’ with grounds teams.
