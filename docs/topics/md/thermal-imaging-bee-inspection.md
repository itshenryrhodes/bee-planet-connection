> **At a Glance:** Thermal imaging detects brood patterns and colony health without opening hives.

## Why it Matters
- Minimises hive disturbance.
- Quick screening for queenrightness and cluster size.

## Step-by-Step
1) Use handheld or drone-mounted thermal camera.
2) Capture images in early morning or evening for contrast.
3) Compare thermal patterns with known healthy baselines.

## Common Pitfalls
- Direct sun interference
- Misinterpreting heat signatures

## Further Reading
- Research on thermal detection of bee colonies
