> **At a Glance:** Managed drone populations support mating success and genetic goals. Feed and stage drone comb thoughtfully.

## Why it Matters
- Improves queen mating and colony traits.
- Buffers poor weather windows.

## Objectives
- Stage drone comb in chosen breeder colonies.
- Synchronise drones with queen rearing calendar.
- Support nutrition for strong drone quality.

## What Good Looks Like
- Healthy, well-fed colonies producing ample drones.
- Drone brood staged 24–28 days before mating flights.
- Apiary density supports mating area.

## Step-by-Step
1) Select breeder colonies with desired traits.
2) Insert drone comb; boost nutrition; avoid mite spikes.
3) Track emergence; align with queen cell timing.
4) Monitor flight days; adjust schedule as needed.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Cool springs delay flights; keep flexibility.
- Drought reduces drone quality—feed as needed.

## Data & Thresholds
- Drone frame counts and emergence dates.
- Weather windows for flights.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Low drone numbers -> Add comb earlier; improve feed.
- Poor mating -> Recheck weather windows and drone sources.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overloading weak colonies with drone comb.
- Ignoring mite management in breeder hives.
- Mismatching timing with queen rearing.

## Tools & Techniques
- Drone foundation, pollen/protein support, calendars.
- Mating yard notes and simple weather logs.

## Safety & Compliance
- Biosecurity between breeder and production yards.
- Record lineage decisions.

## Field Checklist
- Breeder list set; comb staged.
- Nutrition plan active.
- Mating windows identified.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain drone timing to helpers using the queen calendar.
