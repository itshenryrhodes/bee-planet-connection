> **At a Glance:** Feed with purpose: support growth, prevent starvation, and avoid honey contamination. Balance carbs, protein, and minerals.

## Why it Matters
- Nutrition underpins immunity, brood, and temperament.
- Over/under-feeding causes swarming or starvation.

## Objectives
- Define when to feed (stores floors, dearth map).
- Choose feed type (syrup ratios, fondant, pollen subs).
- Record inputs and outcomes.

## What Good Looks Like
- Clear stores floors per season; nucs prioritised.
- Protein support only when needed and legally permitted.
- No feed in supers; diary ties feed to results.

## Step-by-Step
1) Assess: weigh/peek for stores; check brood and weather.
2) Pick feed: light syrup for build, heavy for winter stores, fondant for cold snaps.
3) Place cleanly; reduce entrances; recheck in 3–7 days.
4) Stop when targets met; adjust comb/space to avoid backfilling.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Cold snaps favour fondant; hot dearth needs robbing control.
- Late season avoid stimulative surges before winter bees.

## Data & Thresholds
- Stores floors per box/nuc.
- Protein support trigger (brood/pollen ratio).

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Brood but no pollen -> Add sub/frames of pollen if allowed.
- Backfilling -> Add space; reduce syrup; balance nutrition.
- No uptake -> Check queen/health; feeder fit; temperature.

## Common Pitfalls
- Feeding with supers on.
- Sticky drips causing fights.
- Protein feeding without need.

## Tools & Techniques
- Spring scales, frame lift feel, feeder choice, tidy syrups.
- Simple spreadsheet/log.

## Safety & Compliance
- Local rules on protein feeds and additives.
- Label/segregate feed gear vs honey gear.

## Field Checklist
- Need confirmed; method chosen.
- Reducers in; spills avoided.
- Recheck booked.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain why we stop once targets are hit.

- Colony nutrition primers.
- Protein feeding studies.
