> **At a Glance:** Top-bar hives require different management than framed hives.

## Why it Matters
- Promotes natural comb building.
- Accessible to low-cost and small-scale beekeeping.

## Step-by-Step
1) Inspect gently to avoid comb breakage.
2) Rotate bars to manage space and brood nest.
3) Harvest by cutting comb sections.

## Common Pitfalls
- Comb collapse in heat
- Overcrowding due to slower inspections
