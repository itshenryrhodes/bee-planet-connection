> **At a Glance:** Mites prefer drone brood. Provide sacrificial frames, then cut and discard on a schedule to suppress populations.

## Why it Matters
- Non-chemical pressure on mites during build-up.
- Buys time before harsher treatments.

## Objectives
- Install and cycle drone frames methodically.
- Set a firm cut-out schedule aligned to capping.
- Track impact with mite counts.

## What Good Looks Like
- One green drone frame per hive near brood edge.
- Remove and discard/freeze capped drone comb at ~21–24 days.
- Counts show slowed growth vs controls.

## Step-by-Step
1) Place drone foundation early; mark frame for tracking.
2) Inspect weekly; cut when mostly capped; dispose securely.
3) Replace with fresh drone foundation; repeat 2–3 cycles.
4) Sample mites to confirm benefit; adjust cadence.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Best during spring build-up; stop before dearth.
- Cold snaps delay capping—adjust timing.

## Data & Thresholds
- Cycle interval target ~3 weeks in strong colonies.
- Action if worker brood backfills -> reduce drones; add space.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Bees draw worker instead -> Move frame position; warm brood nest.
- Attracting robbers/wax moth -> Freeze and dispose promptly; seal bins.
- No count improvement -> Increase cycles or combine with other IPM.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to remove on time (mite bomb!).
- Too many drone frames weakening worker force.
- Exposing cut comb near hives—triggers robbing.

## Tools & Techniques
- Marked frames, calendar reminders, sharp scraper/knife.
- Freezer or sealed disposal path.

## Safety & Compliance
- Dispose biologically; avoid feeding drone brood to animals.
- Local rules on waste handling.

## Field Checklist
- Frames placed and dated.
- Cut-out scheduled.
- Counts booked to measure impact.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain ethics: temporary drones to protect colonies.

## Further Reading
- IPM guides on drone trapping.
- Field efficacy comparisons.

## Notes
Use a different frame colour for drones to avoid mistakes under time pressure.
