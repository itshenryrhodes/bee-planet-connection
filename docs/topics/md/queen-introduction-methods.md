> **At a Glance:** Successful queen introduction hinges on verifying queenlessness, stabilising temperament, and using a paced release method matched to colony conditions.

## Why it Matters
Failed introductions waste money and time, and can trigger laying workers or swarming behaviour.

## Step-by-Step
Confirm no eggs/open brood for ≥3 days or use a test frame. Place caged queen between brood frames with attendants and candy plug. After 3–5 days, assess acceptance; if hostile, extend caging or use a push-in cage over emerging brood. Recheck for eggs/laying pattern after release.

## Seasonality & Climate
Acceptance improves in nectar flows and with calm weather. Dearth, cold snaps, and aggressive strains need slower introductions.

## Common Pitfalls
Introducing into queen-right or unstable colonies, releasing too soon, or neglecting to break down emergency cells.
