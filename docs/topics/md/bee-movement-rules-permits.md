> **At a Glance:** Moving bees across borders or regions may require notices, inspections, or permits. Plan documents and timings well ahead.

## Why it Matters
- Avoids fines, turn-backs, and biosecurity risks.
- Protects reputation with farmers and authorities.

## Objectives
- List movement rules for your routes and seasons.
- Prepare health certificates and notifications if required.
- Record movements and keep traceability.

## What Good Looks Like
- Movement log with dates, source/destination, permit numbers.
- Pre-move health check and pest status noted.
- Vehicles clean; loads secure; arrivals reported.

## Step-by-Step
1) Identify competent authority and seasonal restrictions.
2) Book inspections/tests early; collect documents.
3) Plan routes, timings (cool hours), and rest stops.
4) On arrival: secure, water if needed, verify queen status.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Night/early morning moves reduce heat stress.
- Storms require extra strapping and route checks.

## Data & Thresholds
- Max stack height and load limits per vehicle.
- Varroa and pest declarations if applicable.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Issue: Delay at checkpoint -> Provide documents; contact authority.
- Issue: Overheat -> Ventilate, water spritz, shade; abort if needed.
- Issue: Post-move drift -> Reorient with grass/branches and reduced entrances.

## Common Pitfalls
- Paperwork started too late.
- Dirty floors attracting pest suspicion.
- Loose lids and straps.

## Tools & Techniques
- Movement logbook, strap kit, screens/vented floors, waterers.
- Pre-move checklist and document folder.

## Safety & Compliance
- Follow transport rules; secure loads legally.
- Respect pesticide buffer notices at destination.

## Field Checklist
- Docs printed and digital.
- Loads strapped and ventilated.
- Arrival checks scheduled.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Confirm timings with landowners and neighbours.

## Further Reading
- Official movement/health certificate guidance.
- Club notes on transport set-ups.
