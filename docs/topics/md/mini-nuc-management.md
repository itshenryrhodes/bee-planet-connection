> **At a Glance:** Mini-nucs save queen-rearing resources but require tight feeding, space, and timing. Keep them dense and well-supplied.

## Why it Matters
- Efficient use of bees and comb.
- Improves mating throughput.

## Objectives
- Standardise charge, feed, and inspection cadence.
- Prevent absconding and starvation.
- Cull or upgrade quickly post-mating.

## What Good Looks Like
- Evenly charged mini-nucs with young bees and feed.
- Simple rotation: introduce cells, check, mark, move.
- Fast decisions post-mating: bank, sell, or re-cage.

## Step-by-Step
1) Charge with shakes of young bees; add fondant/syrup.
2) Introduce ripe cells; shelter from wind/sun extremes.
3) Check emergence/mating; mark queens; record.
4) Consolidate or retire units quickly to avoid drift/rob.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Best in stable warm periods.
- Wind and cold drive absconding—screen and shelter.

## Data & Thresholds
- Days to emergence/mating per batch.
- Feed consumption and survival rates.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- High abscond -> Increase shade/shelter; add brood smell.
- Starvation -> Increase feed frequency; reduce exposure.

## Common Pitfalls
- Running minis too long after mating.
- Under-charging with bees.
- No windbreaks in exposed yards.

## Tools & Techniques
- Mini-nuc boxes, fondant feeders, shade cloth.
- Simple batch sheets and queen marking kit.

## Safety & Compliance
- Secure stands; prevent blow-offs.
- Record lineage and lot codes.

## Field Checklist
- Charged and fed.
- Cells introduced on schedule.
- Exit plan per unit.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Teach the ‘charge → cell → check → decide’ loop.

## Notes
Keep minis clustered with windbreaks; orientation marks reduce drift.
