> **At a Glance:** Weight, temp/humidity, and sound sensors turn hives into data sources—use them to time flows, detect swarms, and guide interventions.

## Why it Matters
- Objective trends beat guesswork for timing and travel.
- Early alerts reduce losses and wasted visits.

## Objectives
- Choose sensor set (scale, temp/RH, sound).
- Standardise install and data logging cadence.
- Turn signals into actions (alerts, checklists).

## What Good Looks Like
- Calibrated scale per yard; probe in brood area; sound mic sheltered.
- Daily ingest to sheet/app; simple visual dashboard.
- Action rules: weight surge → super; drop → dearth SOP.

## Step-by-Step
1) Install per maker guidance; record baselines.
2) Set data pipeline (CSV/app) and alert thresholds.
3) Link alerts to field tasks; review weekly.
4) Maintain/clean sensors; re-calibrate quarterly.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Cold affects batteries and weight readings; insulate electronics.
- Heat raises RH noise; position probes consistently.

## Data & Thresholds
- Surge threshold (e.g., >1.5–2 kg/day) to super.
- Drop rates to flag dearth/robbing.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Flat lines -> Power/data failure; check device.
- Noisy sound -> Wind; relocate mic or add shield.
- Temp spike -> Swarm or brood break; confirm in field.

## Common Pitfalls
- Too many metrics, no actions.
- Uncalibrated scales; moving hives without notes.
- Probes in wrong place (honey supers!).

## Tools & Techniques
- Standalone scales, IoT loggers, simple scripts to a sheet.
- Dashboards with traffic-light rules.

## Safety & Compliance
- Secure devices; avoid trip hazards and theft.
- Respect site data/privacy policies.

## Field Checklist
- Sensors powered and logging.
- Thresholds set and tested.
- Maintenance calendar in place.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Teach what signals mean and what to do next.

## Further Reading
- Open-source hive scale builds.
- Interpreting sound signatures.

## Notes
Keep one ‘control’ hive without sensors—sanity check field reality vs graphs.
