> **At a Glance:** Pick one or two platforms, post consistently, and tell short, useful stories. Don’t chase every trend.

## Why it Matters
- Drives discovery and teaches customers how to buy.
- Supports press and wholesale with visible activity.

## Objectives
- Define platform + cadence (e.g., Instagram 3×/wk).
- Create repeatable content pillars (apiary, product, events).
- Measure saves/clicks; iterate.

## What Good Looks Like
- Shot list per week; captions in plain language; alt text added.
- Link-in-bio updated; pinned post: where to buy.
- Comments answered within 24 h.

## Step-by-Step
1) Choose platforms; set cadence and pillars.
2) Batch-shoot weekly; write captions; schedule.
3) Engage 10–15 min after posting; answer questions.
4) Monthly review: best/worst posts; refine.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Swarm/harvest seasons = behind-the-scenes stories.
- Winter = education and gifting.

## Data & Thresholds
- Track saves/clicks over likes; watch DM conversion.
- Aim for 3–5 pillars; 80/20 helpful vs selling.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Low reach -> Improve hooks; post at audience times.
- Few clicks -> Clearer CTA; update link hub.
- Trolls -> Hide/block; avoid arguments.

## Common Pitfalls
- Posting only sales asks.
- Overlong text on image.
- Inconsistent branding.

## Tools & Techniques
- Scheduler, caption bank, hashtag notes, alt-text checklist.
- UGC re-share policy and permissions.

## Safety & Compliance
- Ad disclosures for gifted items.
- Privacy: avoid exact hive locations.

## Field Checklist
- This week’s plan set.
- Link hub checked.
- Replies done.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Use real voices; avoid corporate sheen.

## Further Reading
- Small brand social playbooks.
- Alt text and accessibility guides.
