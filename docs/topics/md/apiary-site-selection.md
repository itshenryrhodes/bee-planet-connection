> **At a Glance:** Pick dry, sunny, sheltered, and accessible spots with water nearby and neighbours on-side. Think flight paths, forage radius, and legal access.

## Why it Matters
- Reduces losses and complaints.
- Improves productivity and inspection safety.

## Objectives
- Assess microclimate, forage, water, and access.
- Map landowner permissions and liabilities.
- Plan buffer zones for paths, livestock, and homes.

## What Good Looks Like
- Morning sun, windbreak, firm ground, winter access.
- Entrances face away from paths/homes; clear flight corridors.
- Parking within safe carry distance; secure stand positions.

## Step-by-Step
1) Visit twice: still day and windy/rainy day; note pooling, shade, traffic.
2) Check forage within 2–3 km; map dearth windows.
3) Confirm rights: written permission, gate codes, vehicle access.
4) Place stands level; add 3–5 m visual screen; brief neighbours.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Flood risk after storms; avoid hollows.
- Summer heat needs shade/water; winter needs windbreak.

## Data & Thresholds
- Hardstanding load for vehicles; slope <5° for safe stacks.
- Min 3 m setback from public paths (more if line-of-sight).

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Persistent damp -> Raise stands; move site if mould persists.
- Complaints -> Re-orient flight; add screens; adjust hours.
- Poor yields -> Forage gap; add forage/relocate/limit hive count.

## Common Pitfalls
- Chasing a pretty view not practical access.
- No screen for footpaths.
- Too many hives for local forage.

## Tools & Techniques
- Compass, clinometer/phone, soil auger, forage notes.
- Screens: hedging, fencing, wind netting.

## Safety & Compliance
- Landowner agreement and public liability.
- Check local siting bylaws and movement rules.

## Field Checklist
- Access confirmed year-round.
- Stands level; screens up.
- Neighbours briefed; signs posted.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Share a one-page site brief with helpers and landowner.

## Further Reading
- Apiary siting guidelines.
- Right-to-keep and nuisance basics.
