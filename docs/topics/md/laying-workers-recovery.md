> **At a Glance:** Colonies long queenless may develop laying workers producing multiple eggs per cell and drone brood in worker cells. Recovery requires stabilising pheromones and paced queen introduction.

## Why it Matters
Without intervention, colonies spiral down: no worker brood, dwindling population, and aggressive temperament.

## Step-by-Step
Confirm diagnosis (multiple eggs, bullet cappings, chaotic pattern). Add a frame of open brood weekly for 2â€“3 weeks to suppress laying workers. Combine with a queen-right nuc via newspaper or introduce a caged queen using a push-in cage over emerging brood. Verify eggs/laying pattern after release.

## Seasonality & Climate
Best during nectar flows and mild weather; late-season attempts may fail due to low population and poor acceptance.

## Common Pitfalls
Introducing a queen too early; failing to verify queenlessness; not providing open brood to reset pheromones.
