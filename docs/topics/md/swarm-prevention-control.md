> **At a Glance:** Swarm prevention reduces impulse; control manages it once started.

## Why it Matters
- Essential for apiary stability.
- Supports honey yields.

## Step-by-Step
1) Add supers early and balance brood nest.
2) Remove swarm cells on inspection.
3) Apply Pagden or Snelgrove methods if cells persist.

## Common Pitfalls
- Too few inspections
- Confusing queen cups with swarm cells

## Further Reading
- Classic swarm control texts
