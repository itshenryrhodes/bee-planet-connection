> **At a Glance:** Nosema (N. ceranae, N. apis) is a microsporidian gut parasite that reduces longevity and productivity. Management hinges on stress reduction, nutrition, and timely diagnostics.

## Why it Matters
- Shortened worker lifespan depresses foraging and brood care, undermining yield and overwintering.
- Subclinical infections can masquerade as ‘poor performance’ and queen issues.
- Good hygiene and nutrition reduce incidence without reliance on banned/limited medications.

## Objectives
- Recognise risk patterns and differentiate from other causes of dwindling.
- Adopt a simple sampling protocol and track results over time.
- Mitigate via nutrition, comb renewal, moisture control, and stress reduction.

## What Good Looks Like
- Seasonal sampling (spring/autumn) with a consistent microscope method.
- Strong colonies on fresh comb, adequate pollen, and dry, well-ventilated hives.
- Records show reduction in spore counts alongside management changes.

## Step-by-Step
1) Suspect nosema if: reduced flight, dysentery on frames, poor spring build-up, or queen supersedure patterns with no other clear cause.
2) Sample: collect 30 foragers or young bees from brood nest; keep cool; macerate in water; examine under microscope; record semi-quantitatively.
3) Interventions: improve nutrition (pollen sources or patties), reduce moisture/condensation, renew old comb, avoid prolonged syrup feeding in cold/damp.
4) Strengthen: equalise frames/bees; remove failing queens; reduce manipulations during cold spells.
5) Follow-up: re-sample 3–6 weeks later; adjust actions based on trend.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Late winter–spring stress elevates risk; damp maritime climates amplify it.
- Summer dearth and heat stress also correlate with N. ceranae expression.

## Data & Thresholds
- Track spore load trend rather than a single absolute value.
- High spore loads plus clinical signs warrant maximum hygiene/nutrition focus.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Dysentery on frames in late winter -> Review moisture/ventilation -> Renew feed practices -> Consider nosema sampling.
- Symptom: Dwindling with adequate stores and low varroa -> Sample for nosema; renew comb; strengthen colony.
- Symptom: Recurrent spring slow-start across yard -> Yard-wide comb cycle and pollen focus.

## Common Pitfalls
- Assuming all slow colonies have nosema without sampling.
- Overfeeding syrup in cold/damp causing moisture stress.
- Ignoring comb age and ventilation.

## Tools & Techniques
- Microscope (400x), simple maceration kit, sample vials.
- Pollen patties (season-appropriate), insulation and tilt for moisture control.

## Safety & Compliance
- Follow local rules regarding medications and sampling transport.
- Hygienic handling of bee samples and tools.

## Field Checklist
- Samples taken and logged.
- Comb age recorded; renewal plan active.
- Moisture/ventilation reviewed; nutrition plan set.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain to helpers why ‘dry and fed’ beats chasing meds.
