> **At a Glance:** Supering strategy balances colony expansion and honey yield.

## Why it Matters
- Delays or mis-timed supering reduce crop potential.
- Improves swarm control.

## Step-by-Step
1) Add supers when brood box is 70% full.
2) Alternate drawn comb and foundation if available.
3) Monitor nectar flow and adjust super count.

## Seasonality & Climate
Early supering in strong spring flows; adjust for local forage timing.

## Common Pitfalls
- Adding too late
- Stacking too many supers without bees to cover

## Further Reading
- Swienty beekeeping guides
