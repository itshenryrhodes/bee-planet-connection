> **At a Glance:** After transport, stabilise colonies quickly: ventilation, water, space, and a calm first inspection prevent setbacks that erase the value of moving.

## Why it Matters
Heat, vibration, and confinement stress queens and nurse bees. Recovery protocols preserve brood viability and foraging readiness.

## Step-by-Step
Unload in the cool; level and space pallets; open entrances progressively; provide immediate water. Within 24â€“48 hours verify queen-rightness and brood pattern on a sample; add space if flows are on; feed lightly if thin. Note any grower spray notices and set monitoring cadence.

## Seasonality & Climate
High heat demands extra ventilation and water; cold snaps call for windbreaks and conservative openings.

## Common Pitfalls
Full inspections on day one, parking in wind tunnels, and failing to document issues for grower/insurer follow-up.
