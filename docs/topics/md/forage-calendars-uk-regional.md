> **At a Glance:** UK bloom timing varies by region and altitude. Track local shifts to time supering and feeding accurately.

## Why it Matters
- Improves yield prediction and staffing.
- Supports market stories about place and season.

## Objectives
- Build regional variants (SE, SW, Midlands, Wales, N England, Scotland, NI).
- Capture altitude and coastal effects.
- Tie to weight data from sentinel hives.

## What Good Looks Like
- Regional tables with ± windows vs baseline.
- Photos and local cues (e.g., hawthorn before blackberry).
- Annual update with ‘earliest/latest’ notes.

## Step-by-Step
1) Start with a national template; add regional offsets.
2) Collect local beekeeper inputs and scale logs.
3) Publish regional sheets; review post-season.
4) Adjust offsets and add new indicator species.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Warm springs bring earlier flows; late frosts reset timing.
- Ivy highly regional—note coastal vs inland differences.

## Data & Thresholds
- Offset days vs baseline for each key species.
- Regional daily delta thresholds for supering.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Issue: Calendar mismatch -> Increase local contributors; use sentinel hives.
- Issue: Dearth misjudged -> Add drought-tolerant gap species per region.
- Issue: Conflicting reports -> Weight data wins; document anomalies.

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating the UK as one zone.
- No altitude notes for uplands.
- Over-relying on single-club anecdotes.

## Tools & Techniques
- Shared map with regional layers; photo pins by date.
- Small survey form for bloom reports.

## Safety & Compliance
- Respect land access rules when scouting.
- Avoid publishing exact hive locations.

## Field Checklist
- Regional sheets printed/linked.
- Sentinel data flowing.
- Offsets updated after review.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Label jars with region stories and bloom windows.

## Further Reading
- Regional beekeeping association notes.
- Long-term phenology observations.

## Notes
Keep a ‘weird year’ log—extremes teach more than averages.
