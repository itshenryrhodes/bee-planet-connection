> **At a Glance:** Handle queens like perishables: stable temps, gentle ventilation, short banking periods, and hydration.

## Why it Matters
- Preserves queen quality and pheromones.
- Reduces losses during busy requeening weeks.

## Objectives
- Set up a safe queen bank or nuc bank.
- Transport within optimal temperature and duration.
- Track lineage and age accurately.

## What Good Looks Like
- Bank in strong queenless cell-builder or queenright with excluder cage zone.
- Transport at ~15–25 °C, shaded, upright; hydrate candy.
- Log each queen’s source, date, and outcome.

## Step-by-Step
1) Prepare bank colony: populous, feed present, low stress.
2) Place cages between frames per method; avoid crushing.
3) Transport with insulated box; avoid hot dashboards and cold winds.
4) Limit banking duration; rotate out with priority for older cages.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Heat waves demand insulated coolers; winter needs gentle warming.
- High nectar flows reduce acceptance—banking location matters.

## Data & Thresholds
- Banking duration limit (e.g., ≤2–3 weeks ideal).
- Temp log for transport; rejection rate tracked.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- High rejection -> Rebuild bank strength; check queenright leakage.
- Candy drying/crumble -> Replace; add damp sponge (no drips).
- Wing damage -> Review handling and cage clearance.

## Common Pitfalls
- Leaving cages in hot vehicles.
- Banking in weak colonies.
- No records of lineage/outcomes.

## Tools & Techniques
- Insulated carrier, temp logger, spare candy, humid sponge.
- Excluder frames/push-in cages for short holds.

## Safety & Compliance
- Transport rules for live insects; import paperwork.
- Avoid spreading disease—inspect and isolate suspect cages.

## Field Checklist
- Bank strong; food present.
- Cages secure and spaced.
- Transport plan and log ready.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Tell helpers: queens don’t like hot cars or cold winds.

## Notes
Prioritise oldest cages first—FIFO prevents silent decline in pheromone quality.
