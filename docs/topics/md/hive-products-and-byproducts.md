> **At a Glance:** Hive outputs include honey, wax, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly. Each requires clean processing, temperature control, and clear batch records.

## Why it Matters
- Diversifying products stabilises income and showcases pollinator value.
- Quality handling protects flavour, aroma, and safety.

## Objectives
- Implement food-safe workflows with minimal heat and moisture exposure.
- Maintain batch traceability and accurate labelling.
- Harvest without weakening colonies.

## What Good Looks Like
- Clean room for extraction, filtered air where possible.
- Honey settled and bottled at stable temps.
- Wax rendered gently and filtered to grade.
- Pollen dried at low heat and stored airtight.
- Propolis collected on screens and cleaned post-freeze.

## Step-by-Step
1) Honey - test cappings for ripeness, uncap, extract, coarse strain, settle, fine filter if used, bottle warm not hot.
2) Wax - collect cappings, wash, render in water bath, filter through cloth, cast blocks.
3) Pollen - install traps intermittently, dry <45 C, store light and oxygen tight.
4) Propolis - use mats, freeze, flex and scrape, sieve fragments, consider tincture production.
5) Royal jelly - specialised grafting, strict cold chain, niche market.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Main honey and pollen align with local flows.
- Warm periods increase propolis yield.
- Humidity control matters for honey moisture and pollen storage.

## Data & Thresholds
- Honey moisture target â‰¤18 percent for stability.
- Pollen trapping - limit to avoid brood stress.
- Wax temperatures - avoid overheating that darkens or scorches.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Fermentation notes -> Measure moisture -> Blend with drier lots or dehumidify before bottling.
- Symptom: Cloudy honey concerns -> Educate on crystallisation -> Offer soft-set option.
- Symptom: Weak colony after pollen trapping -> Reduce trap days or suspend.

## Common Pitfalls
- Overheating honey, degrading enzymes and aroma.
- Overharvesting pollen during brood expansion.
- Poor storage causing propolis contamination.

## Tools & Techniques
- Refractometer, stainless extractors, food-grade buckets.
- Low-heat dryers, vacuum containers, fine sieves.
- Double boilers for wax, nylon filters, silicone moulds.

## Safety & Compliance
- Food hygiene standards, allergen labelling for pollen and propolis.
- Accurate weights and batch dates on labels.
- Keep cleaning and temperature logs.

## Field Checklist
- Room clean and dry.
- Refractometer calibrated.
- Batch code assigned.
- Lids sealed and labelled.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain natural crystallisation and floral notes to customers.
