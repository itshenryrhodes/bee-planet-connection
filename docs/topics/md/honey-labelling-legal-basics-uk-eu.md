> **At a Glance:** Selling honey is simple when labels are right. Put the name of the food (‘Honey’), net weight in metric (e.g., 227 g / 340 g), durability date (‘Best before’), lot/batch code, your business name/address, country of origin, and any special storage advice. If it’s a specific floral/region claim, be able to substantiate it. Small producers are usually nutrition-panel exempt; allergens aren’t typical for pure honey but cross-contamination statements must be honest. Labels must be legible, indelible and visible. Keep a sample and a batch log so you can answer questions later with confidence.

## Why it Matters
Compliance builds trust and keeps market days stress-free. Trading Standards care about weights, identity and traceability; customers care about clarity and provenance. A clean label and a tidy batch log protect you if a jar leaves the table with a smudge or if a customer calls with a question months later. If you add nuts, spices or infusions, you enter different territory (PPDS/prepacked for direct sale and allergens)—write a separate SOP for that range. Country-of-origin wording and floral claims need integrity: if your jars say ‘English Honey’, your records should show apiaries and dates that back it up. Finally, lot codes connect jars to days and supers; if you ever need to withdraw a batch, you’ll do it calmly in minutes, not in a panic. Good labels aren’t just legal—they’re your quiet promise of care from hive to shelf.

## Step-by-Step
- Decide pack sizes; calibrate scales; check tare.
- Design labels with required fields (name, net weight, BBE, lot, address, origin).
- Print/apply consistently; keep labels neat and legible.
- Maintain a batch log (date/apiary/boxes/jar count/lot).
- Keep retention samples; review yearly against regs/Trading Standards advice.

## Seasonality & Climate
Busy after extraction; plan label stock ahead of flows to avoid last-minute reprints.

## Common Pitfalls
- Imperial-only weights; missing origin; illegible type.
- Floral/region claims with no evidence trail.
- Mixing infused/PPDS rules into pure honey range.
