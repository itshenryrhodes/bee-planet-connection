> **At a Glance:** Pure beeswax needs correct wick size, steady pour temps, and patient cooling to burn cleanly.

## Why it Matters
- Right wick and pour avoid tunnelling and soot.
- Candle line adds value to wax rendering.

## Objectives
- Match wick to diameter and wax blend.
- Control pour and cool to prevent cracks and sinkholes.
- Standardise labelling and burn-test SOP.

## What Good Looks Like
- Consistent melt temps; single-pour pillars if possible.
- Wicks pre-tested; self-extinguish height labelled.
- Batch cards with wick code and burn-time tests.

## Step-by-Step
1) Render/clean wax; choose wick by diameter.
2) Melt in double boiler; pour at steady temp; avoid bubbles.
3) Cool slowly; repour tops if needed; trim wicks.
4) Cure 24–48 h; burn-test per batch; label warnings.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Cold rooms crack tops—warm moulds/containers.
- Hot rooms slump—cool staged racks and airflow.

## Data & Thresholds
- Pour temperature and diameter-to-wick chart logged.
- Burn time targets by size; soot threshold not exceeded.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Tunnelling -> Wick up; longer initial burn advice.
- Symptom: Soot -> Wick down or trim; verify wax purity.
- Symptom: Cracks/sinkholes -> Adjust pour temp and cooling rate.

## Common Pitfalls
- Guessing wicks; no burn tests.
- Pouring too cool/hot.
- Scented rooms tainting wax.

## Tools & Techniques
- Double boilers, thermometers, wick holders, heat gun for tops.
- Burn-test rig with timers and soot cards.

## Safety & Compliance
- CLP/warning labels where required.
- Fire safety during pours and tests.

## Field Checklist
- Wicks matched and centred.
- Pour temps logged.
- Burn tests recorded; labels applied.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Teach first burn instructions on the box.

## Further Reading
- Wick manufacturer charts.
- Candle safety labelling guides.
