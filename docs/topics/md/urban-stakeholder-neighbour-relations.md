> **At a Glance:** Urban yards succeed on soft skills: proactive neighbour comms, clear signage, tidy kit, and swift complaint handling.

## Why it Matters
- Perception drives permissions.
- One sting incident or messy yard can shutter multiple sites.

## Step-by-Step
1) Pre-site checklist (access, water, shade, flight paths).
2) Written agreement with landlord.
3) Welcome sheet to neighbours with hornet/reporting info and beekeeper contact.
4) Office-hours inspections.
5) Incident log and escalation pathway.

## Seasonality & Climate
Heat islands intensify summer dearth and overheating â€” plan shade and water early.

## Common Pitfalls
- Open feeding
- Wide entrances near walkways
- Unannounced swarm visits
