> **At a Glance:** Rotate dark comb out to cut residue load and disease risk. Plan a 3–5 year cycle with marked frames.

## Why it Matters
- Improves brood health and hygiene.
- Reduces chemical residues and spore build-up.

## Objectives
- Adopt a visual marking system for comb age.
- Replace oldest frames annually without shocking colonies.
- Coordinate with supering and splits.

## What Good Looks Like
- Colour/year-coded top bars; cull policy for black/patchy comb.
- Brood boxes refreshed gradually in spring/autumn windows.
- Culled comb rendered or destroyed per biosecurity.

## Step-by-Step
1) Mark frames by year; log in notes.
2) Replace 2–3 oldest brood frames per year per hive.
3) Use foundation/foundationless per plan; keep brood pattern straight.
4) Dispose/render safely; do not store suspect comb with good wax.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Spring is ideal as colonies expand; avoid deep dearth swaps.
- Autumn rotates before winter bees are raised.

## Data & Thresholds
- Max age target for brood comb (e.g., 3–5 years).
- Culling triggers: blackness, patchy brood, visible damage.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Drone-heavy cells -> Rotate out; add fresh worker foundation.
- Symptom: Chalkbrood/AFB risk -> Cull and escalate per SOP/law.
- Symptom: Honey bound brood nest -> Remove heavy outside frames; add space.

## Common Pitfalls
- Mass replacement causing brood chill.
- Unmarked frames—no one knows age.
- Storing suspect comb near clean equipment.

## Tools & Techniques
- Frame markers, spare foundation, nucs for temporary brood.
- Melter and biosecure disposal containers.

## Safety & Compliance
- Local rules for burning/destroying disease suspect comb.
- PPE and hygiene when handling suspect frames.

## Field Checklist
- Oldest frames identified.
- Replacements ready.
- Disposal/render path arranged.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain to club: fresh comb = healthier brood.

## Further Reading
- Comb replacement guidance.
- Residue studies by comb age.

Use split/nuc creation to ‘park’ brood during heavy renewal.
