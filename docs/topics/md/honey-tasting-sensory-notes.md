> **At a Glance:** Teach simple sensory: colour, aroma, flavour, texture, aftertaste. Use shared vocabulary and short, honest notes.

## Why it Matters
- Improves product selection and storytelling.
- Engages customers and retailers.

## Objectives
- Adopt a house tasting card and descriptors.
- Run short team tastings each season.
- Use notes on labels, web, and pitches.

## What Good Looks Like
- 5-minute tastings: dry cracker, water, 2–3 samples max.
- Common lexicon with examples (floral, malty, resinous, citrus).
- Photos and notes archived by batch.

## Step-by-Step
1) Prepare neutral palate kit; set light and table.
2) Evaluate colour (scale), aroma (orthonasal), texture, flavour, finish.
3) Write 2–3 descriptors; avoid medical claims; note pairing ideas.
4) Save to batch folder; update product pages.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Spring lighter/floral; late season darker/resinous common.
- Heat affects viscosity—standardise temp for tastings.

## Data & Thresholds
- Two tasters minimum; break ties with reference jar.
- Do not exceed 3 samples/session to avoid palate fatigue.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Disagreement -> Re-taste blind; pick shared descriptors only.
- Customer confusion -> Add pairing card or comparison photo.
- Off-notes -> Check storage/heating history; re-test moisture.

## Common Pitfalls
- Flowery marketing with zero substance.
- Too many descriptors; inconsistent across SKUs.
- Tasting after spicy food/coffee.

## Tools & Techniques
- Colour chart, tasting spoons, crackers, water, note cards.
- Light tent for colour-standard photos.

## Safety & Compliance
- No health/medicinal claims.
- Allergen/ingredient info accurate on cards/labels.

## Field Checklist
- Reference jars present.
- Cards printed; pens ready.
- Photos taken; notes filed.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Keep it human: two honest descriptors beat ten fancy ones.
