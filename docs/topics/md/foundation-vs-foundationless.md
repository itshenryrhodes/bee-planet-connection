> **At a Glance:** Foundation gives speed and uniformity; foundationless gives wax purity and natural cell variation. Choose per goal, season, and skill.

## Why it Matters
- Straight comb speeds inspections and extraction.
- Natural comb supports wax purity claims and flexible brood sizing.

## Objectives
- Select a default approach per yard and flow timing.
- Provide guides and swarm-control context for foundationless.
- Standardise extraction readiness criteria.

## What Good Looks Like
- Foundation drawn straight on warm flow; frames wired where spun.
- Foundationless started between straight comb with guides and strong nectar.
- Clear rule: do not spin fresh foundationless until fully attached and cured.

## Step-by-Step
1) Decide per box: brood may mix; supers often foundation for spin strength.
2) For foundationless: install wedge/groove guides; place between drawn frames.
3) Inspect early for waviness; correct before hardening.
4) For extraction: test strength; avoid high RPM on new comb.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Use strong flows for foundationless draw; avoid dearth and cold starts.
- Heat softens comb—adjust handling and spin speeds.

## Data & Thresholds
- Minimum two drawn frames adjacent when starting a foundationless run.
- Spin speed limited for first-season comb (lower RPM).

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Wavy comb -> Insert straighteners; rotate position; add foundation adjacent.
- Symptom: Blowouts in extractor -> Reduce RPM; allow more curing time.
- Symptom: Patchy draw -> Feed lightly or wait for stronger flow.

## Common Pitfalls
- Starting foundationless on weak colonies or dearth.
- Spinning uncured comb.
- No guides causing cross comb.

## Tools & Techniques
- Wedge/top-bar guides, fishing line/wire for strength, comb straighteners.
- Extractor with variable speed and cages for delicate comb.

## Safety & Compliance
- Food-contact approval for foundation material and wiring.
- Keep wax source records if marketing ‘own wax’ claims.

## Field Checklist
- Guides installed; straight neighbours present.
- Flow adequate; feed staged if needed.
- Spin-speed note on boxes with first-year comb.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain trade-offs: speed vs wax purity.

- Frame wiring and guide methods.

Mark first-year supers so harvest crew knows to spin gently.
