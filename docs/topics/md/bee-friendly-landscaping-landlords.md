> **At a Glance:** Make sites easier for bees and people: right plants, tidy edges, safe bins, and signage that sets expectations.

## Why it Matters
- Reduces complaints and improves biodiversity.
- Keeps facilities teams supportive of apiaries.

## Objectives
- Publish a plant and maintenance guide for sites.
- Reduce pesticide use; adopt timing to avoid bloom hits.
- Design bins/water to deter wasps and mess.

## What Good Looks Like
- Perennial beds with seasonal stagger; mulch to save water.
- No spraying during bloom; spot-treat only; record events.
- Bins with lids; water features shallow with pebbles.

## Step-by-Step
1) Audit current beds/lawns; list quick wins and replant items.
2) Agree mowing/strimming zones and ‘no-go’ times near hives.
3) Plant in blocks for signage/education; add scent and colour.
4) Review quarterly with photos and maintenance notes.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Drought-friendly species and mulch in hot summers.
- Winter structure for pollinators and tidy look.

## Data & Thresholds
- Watering frequency targets; pesticide usage log at zero/near-zero.
- Complaint count trend after landscaping changes.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Wasp issues -> Move bins; seal lids; reduce sugar waste.
- Deadhead gaps -> Add staggered bloom species.
- Negative neighbour feedback -> Add screens/signage; adjust routes.

## Common Pitfalls
- One giant lawn with nothing in bloom.
- Planting bee-toxic ornamentals.
- No maintenance budget or owner.

## Tools & Techniques
- Plant lists, mulch, drip lines, signage, QR to planting plan.
- Wasp traps placed away from hives/footfall.

## Safety & Compliance
- Site risk assessments; slips/trips in wet beds.
- Avoid herbicide drift into apiaries.

## Field Checklist
- Planting plan agreed.
- Bins/water sorted.
- Mow/strim rules posted.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Frame as ‘pollinator-friendly grounds’—benefits wider wildlife.

## Further Reading
- Pollinator-friendly planting lists.
- Facilities management biodiversity guides.
