> **At a Glance:** A simple onboarding pack turns eager volunteers into safe, effective helpers.

## Why it Matters
- Improves safety and consistency.
- Reduces supervision load.

## Step-by-Step
1) Provide welcome note, role outline, and risk basics.
2) Issue PPE checklist and apiary rules (biosecurity, gates, neighbours).
3) Assign a buddy for first 3 sessions.
4) Capture emergency contact and allergy info.

## Common Pitfalls
- No clear tasks
- Missing PPE sizing
- Untracked attendance

## Safety & Compliance
Keep GDPR-compliant records; brief on first-aid and sting response.
