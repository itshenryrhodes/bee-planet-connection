> **At a Glance:** Well-sited, well-laid-out apiaries save hours of management time and reduce neighbour impact. Prioritise access, sun/wind balance, safe flight paths, drainage, and security.

## Why it Matters
- Good siting improves colony health, temperament, and productivity.
- Clear access and layout reduce lifting injuries and inspection time.
- Thoughtful orientation lowers public risk and complaints.

## Objectives
- Choose stable, well-drained ground with year-round access.
- Design flight lines that avoid people, animals, and windows.
- Standardise stands, spacing, and hive alignment for efficiency.

## What Good Looks Like
- Sun in the morning, light shade in extreme heat, sheltered from prevailing wind.
- Entrances face safe corridors with screens/fences lifting flight above 2 m.
- Stands level, 300–400 mm off ground, spaced 0.8–1.2 m, consistent alignment.
- Secure, discreet site with clear permission and contact details.

## Step-by-Step
1) Permissions - written agreement with landowner, access times, vehicle rules.
2) Risk map - mark paths, gates, livestock, footfall; plan entrance directions.
3) Ground prep - level pads or railway sleepers; ensure drainage and weed control.
4) Stands & spacing - set a grid; label stands for consistent hive positions.
5) Water source - provide nearby clean water with landing surfaces.
6) Storage & waste - designate zone for supers, tools, wax cappings, trash.
7) Signage & contacts - discreet sign with beekeeper phone/email if appropriate.
8) First install - place nucs/colonies, reduce entrances, observe traffic.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Wet climates require extra drainage and roof straps for storms.
- Urban heat islands may need shade sails and water earlier in season.
- Cold winds demand windbreaks; avoid frost pockets in valleys.

## Data & Thresholds
- Target stand height 30–40 cm to reduce damp and bending strain.
- Keep 2–3 m setback from fences/paths; add 2 m screens where closer.
- One water source per 10–15 colonies as a starting benchmark.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Bees meeting pedestrians -> Re-aim entrances; add screen/fence; raise flight path.
- Symptom: Damp floors/black mould -> Improve drainage, raise stands, add ground cover.
- Symptom: Robbing pressure -> Increase spacing, reduce entrances, tidy drips and stores.

## Common Pitfalls
- Entrances aimed at paths/doors.
- Low stands on boggy ground; heavy boxes soak moisture.
- No vehicle access plan for harvest days.

## Tools & Techniques
- Post level, ground anchors/straps, shade sail kit, windbreak mesh.
- Lockable storage box, spill-proof fuel tin for smoker.
- Reusable pads or slabs for clean footing.

## Safety & Compliance
- Maintain public liability where required.
- Secure chemicals and sharp tools; follow local placement guidance.
- Keep a first-aid kit and sting protocol on site.

## Field Checklist
- Stands level and labelled.
- Entrances oriented safely.
- Water source filled and stable.
- Straps tight; roofs sound.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Hold a neighbour briefing template for urban/residential sites.

## Further Reading
- National Bee Unit siting guidance.
- Local beekeeping association best practices for urban placements.
