> **At a Glance:** Take clean, labelled samples that labs can trust. Chain-of-custody and metadata matter as much as the swab.

## Why it Matters
- Accurate results drive correct actions and avoid false alarms.
- Good records stand up to audits and insurance.

## Objectives
- Standardise swab/smear/larval pick methods.
- Label with location, date, hive ID, and symptoms.
- Ship within time/temperature guidance.

## What Good Looks Like
- Cool chain maintained; leak-proof vials; forms complete.
- Photos and GPS included; incident number if notified.
- Duplicate retain kept frozen where appropriate.

## Step-by-Step
1) Prep: sterile swabs, vials, labels, forms, cooler packs.
2) Sample: target symptomatic cells/frames; avoid cross-contamination.
3) Label immediately; photograph frame + label; seal in second bag.
4) Ship per lab guidance; log tracking; store retain sample.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Heat degrades samples—use cooler packs.
- Cold slows courier times—plan pickup windows.

## Data & Thresholds
- Max hold time before ship (lab-specific, typically <48 h at cool temps).
- Retain period for duplicates (e.g., 30–90 days).

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Leaky shipment risk -> Double-bag; absorbent; rigid mailer.
- Insufficient metadata -> Call lab; supplement by email.
- Negative result but strong field signs -> Re-sample; escalate inspection.

## Common Pitfalls
- Illegible labels; mismatched forms.
- Sampling healthy brood only.
- Shipping on Fridays without confirmation.

## Tools & Techniques
- Pre-printed labels, QR codes to digital forms.
- Disposable scalpels, swabs, vials, coolers.

## Safety & Compliance
- Follow biohazard/animal product mailing rules.
- Decontaminate tools and gloves between hives.

## Field Checklist
- Forms filled; photos saved.
- Cool packs frozen; pickup booked.
- Retain samples labelled and frozen.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Send lab a concise symptom note and photos link.

## Further Reading
- Lab submission guidelines.
- Photo examples of good samples.

## Notes
A cheap label printer and QR form reduce transcription errors dramatically.
