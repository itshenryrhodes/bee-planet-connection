> **At a Glance:** Simple, durable gift packs with clear story and batch codes sell all year—especially Q4.

## Why it Matters
- Raises perceived value and AOV.
- Creates retailer-friendly, ready-to-gift options.

## Objectives
- Standardise 2–3 gift formats with inserts.
- Design packaging for travel durability and shelf appeal.
- Maintain traceability and legal info.

## What Good Looks Like
- Kraft/rigid boxes with inserts; postcards with origin notes.
- Clean labels; batch codes accessible without unboxing.
- Bundle pricing ladder (small, medium, premium).

## Step-by-Step
1) Choose formats and inserts; test drop/ship durability.
2) Create brand card: story, tasting notes, where to find more.
3) Build packing SOP; photo each pack; list components.
4) Track margin and breakages; iterate per season.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Q4 spikes; prepare stock early.
- Heat destroys candles/chocolate pairings—adjust contents.

## Data & Thresholds
- Breakage target <1%; return rate logged.
- Bundle margin vs single-jar margin monitored.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Issue: Shelf scuffing -> Add sleeves/film; improve fit.
- Issue: Low sell-through -> Refresh card; change SKU mix.
- Issue: Barcode/trace missing -> Move codes to outside label.

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-designed packs hard to assemble.
- Loose jars; poor transit protection.
- No batch codes on gifts.

## Tools & Techniques
- Die-cut inserts, belly bands, eco void fill, barcode labels.
- Photography against seasonal backdrops.

## Safety & Compliance
- Weights/measures and allergens visible.
- No misleading claims on gift cards.

## Field Checklist
- Inserts fit; jars snug.
- Batch codes on outer.
- Story cards packed and aligned.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Tell the forage story and pairing ideas.

- Small brand packaging playbooks.
