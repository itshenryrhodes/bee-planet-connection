> **At a Glance:** Guard authenticity with transparent sourcing, clean processes, and evidence. Know red flags and simple tests.

## Why it Matters
- Protects consumer trust and price integrity.
- Differentiates local honey from commodity risks.

## Objectives
- Document your supply chain and batch origin.
- Understand common adulterants and testing options.
- Communicate honestly about variability.

## What Good Looks Like
- Farm-to-jar batch cards; no mystery blends.
- Retain samples kept; periodic lab checks for premium claims.
- Clear statements: unpasteurised, unblended (where true).

## Step-by-Step
1) Map sources and batch coding rigorously.
2) Learn red flags: uniformity too perfect, odd aromas, rapid crystallisation anomalies.
3) Choose affordable lab panels for premium lines; keep certificates.
4) Educate customers on natural variance and florals.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Drought and scarcity tempt shortcuts—double down on records.
- Varietal overlaps in odd years—document clearly.

## Data & Thresholds
- Decide when to lab-test (value threshold per batch).
- Keep retains for all batches for at least one season.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Issue: Buyer query -> Share batch card and retains; offer lab if warranted.
- Issue: Odd reading -> Re-test; check equipment contamination.
- Issue: Supplier blend -> Demand certificates; or stop buying-in.

## Common Pitfalls
- Vague blend descriptions.
- Mixing bought-in with own with weak traceability.
- Over-claiming ‘monofloral’ without evidence.

## Tools & Techniques
- Batch cards, refractometer, microscope/pollen checks (basic), lab partners.
- Tamper-evident seals and honest labels.

## Safety & Compliance
- Follow legal naming; avoid medicinal claims.
- Hold documentation for audits/retailers.

## Field Checklist
- Batch origins clear on label/card.
- Retains stored.
- Certificates filed for premium batches.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Tell the ‘natural variation’ story; avoid hype.

## Further Reading
- Authenticity testing overviews.
- Buyer audit checklists.
