{
  "Overview": "Small hive beetle (Aethina tumida) is an invasive pest that damages comb, honey, and brood. Adults lay eggs in crevices; larvae tunnel through combs, causing fermentation and ‘slime outs’.",
  "Biology & Transmission": "Beetles reproduce in the hive; mature larvae leave to pupate in soil. Movement of colonies, nucs, and equipment can spread infestations between regions.",
  "Symptoms & Field Diagnosis": "Look for running adult beetles under the crown board, larval tunnels in comb, fermented honey odour, and sticky, slimed frames. Check soil around stands in infested areas.",
  "Impact on Colony": "Heavy infestations can cause colony abandonment and loss of saleable honey. Contamination risks are high in warm climates and weak hives.",
  "Control & Treatment": "Maintain strong colonies, limit hive space, and remove excess comb. Use in-hive traps where appropriate; keep apiaries tidy. In regulated regions, follow official containment/eradication protocols and notify authorities.",
  "Prevention & Good Practice": "Quarantine new stock, avoid swapping combs/equipment between apiaries, and manage apiary hygiene. Keep stands off bare soil or use barriers to deter pupation where feasible.",
  "Notes": ""
