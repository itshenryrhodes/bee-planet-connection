  "At-a-Glance": "Keep extraction rooms clean, flows simple, and records tight. Control water, temperature, pests, and cross-contamination.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Protects customers and brand with safe, legal honey.",
    "Prevents ferment, taints, and recalls."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Maintain a clean, segregated, food-safe extraction area.",
    "Control moisture, temperature, and contact surfaces.",
    "Log sanitation, batch IDs, and corrective actions."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Smooth, cleanable surfaces; clear in→out product flow.",
    "Sanitisers and detergent available; tools colour-coded.",
    "Batch sheet ties frames → tank → jars with operator initials."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Pre-op clean: benches, floors, utensils; pest check.",
    "2) Stage supers: keep dry, covered; warm gently if cold comb.",
    "3) Uncap and spin; strain/settle; minimal heating only if necessary.",
    "4) Post-op clean and chemical log; waste wax/honey handled correctly."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Humid spells raise moisture—dry room or use dehumidifier.",
    "Cold rooms raise viscosity—pre-warm comb and tanks carefully."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Target honey moisture ≤18% (varietal dependent).",
    "Room cleaning checklist completed each session."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Foaming/ferment -> Check moisture and cleanliness; segregate; reprocess where allowed.",
    "Symptom: Off-odours -> Inspect room, chemicals, smoke; trace to batch.",
    "Symptom: Particulates -> Improve filtering/settling; inspect strainers."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Wet floors and condensate dripping on open honey.",
    "Dirty cappings tubs and reused, tainted buckets.",
    "Overheating to speed flow."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Food-safe buckets/lids, strainers, sump/settling tanks.",
    "Hygiene station with handwash, hair/beard covers."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Separation from pets/chemicals; no smoking.",
    "COSHH for sanitisers; accurate allergen/label compliance."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Room cleaned and signed off.",
    "Moisture checks logged.",
    "Batch IDs and operator initials recorded."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain minimal handling and batch traceability to customers."
