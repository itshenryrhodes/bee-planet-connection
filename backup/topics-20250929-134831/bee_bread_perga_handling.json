  "At-a-Glance": "Bee bread is fermented pollen—treat frames carefully to preserve cells and prevent contamination when moving or extracting.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Supports nucs and brood; potential product line.",
    "Rough handling ruins cells and spreads mess."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Identify, store, and use bee bread frames properly.",
    "Decide when to feed back vs process.",
    "Keep records of origin and treatment."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Frames frozen to control wax moth before storage.",
    "Cutting/extraction done on clean, cool surface.",
    "Nucs boosted with partial bee bread frames as needed."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Mark frames with strong pollen bands; freeze if storing.",
    "2) For feeding: thaw in sealed bag; install next to brood.",
    "3) For processing: use clean tools; avoid crushing cappings into cells.",
    "4) Record usage; replace frames to donor hive/stock as planned."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Best collected during strong pollen flows.",
    "Heat accelerates spoilage—work cool and quick."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Limit removal so donor colonies keep balance.",
    "Track nuc outcomes after support."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Slimy cells -> Spoilage; discard; review freezing/handling.",
    "Brood still stalled -> Nutrition not the root cause.",
    "Moth damage -> Longer freeze; better sealing."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Harvesting from weak colonies.",
    "Letting frames warm wet before use.",
    "No origin labels."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Freezer, clean knives/scrapers, food-safe trays.",
    "Label system for yard/frame origin."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Food hygiene if processing for humans.",
    "Do not cross-contaminate with treatment residues."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Frames marked and frozen.",
    "Use path chosen (feed vs process).",
    "Records updated."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain why nucs get the best bee bread first."
