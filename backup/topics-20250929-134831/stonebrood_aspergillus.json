  "At-a-Glance": "Stonebrood is a fungal brood disease (Aspergillus spp.) presenting as hard mummified larvae with spore-bearing fuzz. Rare but important for biosecurity and keeper safety.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Zoonotic potential and spore exposure risks for keepers.",
    "Can be confused with chalkbrood without close inspection."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Differentiate stonebrood from chalkbrood accurately.",
    "Handle suspect material safely and escalate per guidance.",
    "Improve hive environment and hygiene to reduce risk."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Prompt isolation of suspect frames; PPE and dust control during removal.",
    "Inspector or lab confirmation before disposal actions.",
    "Improved ventilation and dryness post-incident."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Identify: hard, rock-like brood mummies; coloured sporing fuzz possible.",
    "2) Isolate: avoid shaking frames; bag suspect comb; mark hive.",
    "3) Report/confirm: follow regional guidance; obtain lab confirmation.",
    "4) Remediate: remove and safely dispose per instruction; decontaminate tools; improve microclimate.",
    "5) Follow-up: monitor adjacent colonies; maintain hygiene."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Warm, humid periods favour fungal development.",
    "Poor ventilation and damp gear elevate risk."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Any strong suspicion warrants lab confirmation and heightened hygiene.",
    "Track incidents with photos, dates, and weather context."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Hard mummies vs chalky brittle -> Suspect stonebrood -> Bag and confirm.",
    "Symptom: Yard hygiene issues -> Clean extraction/storage; dry equipment.",
    "Symptom: Repeated events -> Review siting and ventilation across yard."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Scraping mummies in the yard, spreading spores.",
    "Confusing with chalkbrood and missing PPE."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Seal-able bags, gloves/respirator as warranted, flame/approved disinfectants for tools.",
    "Moisture control tools: insulation, quilts, vents."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Use respiratory protection when handling dusty/dead comb.",
    "Follow disposal guidance; protect bystanders."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Frames bagged and labelled.",
    "Tools decontaminated.",
    "Ventilation/moisture plan updated."
  ],
  "Communications": [
