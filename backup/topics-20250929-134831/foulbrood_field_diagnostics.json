  "At-a-Glance": "Recognise and escalate American/European foulbrood rapidly. Field checks guide immediate isolation and legal reporting.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Early recognition limits spread and legal consequences.",
    "Protects brand reputation and neighbouring beekeepers."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Differentiate AFB vs EFB field signs confidently.",
    "Apply isolation and notification steps without delay.",
    "Capture photo/record evidence for inspectors."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Pocket kit ready: matchsticks, disposable gloves, bags, camera.",
    "Isolation protocol enacted: close, strap, mark, do not move.",
    "Timely notification to competent authority per jurisdiction."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Observe brood pattern, cappings, odour. Note ropey test and cell contents.",
    "2) If suspect: stop manipulation; close colony; take GPS/photo notes.",
    "3) Rope test (AFB): insert/withdraw match for thread; record result.",
    "4) Call/report per local law; follow inspector guidance; quarantine yard gear."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "EFB peaks often in spring/early summer with nutrition stress.",
    "AFB can present any season; stressed colonies show earlier."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Do not move bees/comb once AFB is suspected—legal threshold is suspicion.",
    "Maintain a ‘suspect incident’ log with dates, photos, actions."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Sunken perforated cappings + ropey test + dark larval scale → AFB: isolate + notify.",
    "Twisted yellowish larvae, non-ropey, often patchy brood → EFB: notify; follow sampling/treatment policy.",
    "Chilled brood/CBR lookalikes → Verify temp/ventilation; recheck next visit."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Continuing inspections across hives after suspicion.",
    "Using shared tools/gloves without sterilising.",
    "Posting photos publicly before notifying authorities."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Rope test sticks, disposable gloves, sealable bags, bleach/soda ash for decon.",
    "Quick-reference photo card laminated in truck."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Local notifiable disease rules; movement restrictions.",
    "Incineration or treatment orders compliance."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Photos taken and labelled.",
    "Hive closed/marked; kit quarantined.",
    "Authority notified; incident log updated."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Calm, factual updates to stakeholders; no speculation."
