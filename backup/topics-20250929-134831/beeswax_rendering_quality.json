  "At-a-Glance": "Gentle heat, clean water, and fine filtering make bright wax with low debris and odour.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Quality wax sells better and performs in candles/cosmetics.",
    "Dirty or overheated wax smells and darkens."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Sort sources (cappings vs brood comb).",
    "Render at low temperatures with water separation.",
    "Filter progressively to final clarity."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Cappings rendered separately; brood comb de-gunked first.",
    "Thermostat-controlled melter; no boiling; slow cool for sludge drop.",
    "Final pass through fine mesh/paper."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Sort and roughly clean; remove wires/plastic.",
    "2) Melt gently in water bath; avoid agitation.",
    "3) Allow to set; scrape slumgum; repeat if needed.",
    "4) Filter hot through cloth/paper; pour into moulds."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Cold rooms speed setting—reduce cracks by controlled cooling.",
    "Hot days need shade and careful handling."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Wax temp kept well below boiling (aim <90 °C bath).",
    "Yield and colour notes recorded per source."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Dark/odour -> Lower temps; switch to cleaner feedstock.",
    "Symptom: Debris in cakes -> Finer filter; re-render.",
    "Symptom: Layered contamination -> Increase settle time; scrape better."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Boiling wax/water mixes.",
    "Mixing brood comb with cappings.",
    "Pouring too cool causing ripples and voids."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Steam/water jacket melter, filters, settling buckets, thermometers.",
    "Silicone moulds and labelled cooling racks."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Fire precautions; no water into hot wax.",
    "Food/cosmetic grade separation as needed."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Sources sorted.",
    "Temps stable; filters ready.",
    "Cakes labelled by batch."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain grade differences to buyers."
