  "At-a-Glance": "Simple maps reveal forage, water, and access. Use open GIS to plan yards, flight paths, and planting projects.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Aligns hive counts to carrying capacity.",
    "Targets planting where it matters most."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Collect base layers: land use, water, canopy, paths.",
    "Add bloom notes and hive scale data.",
    "Publish easy-to-read yard maps for teams."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "2–3 km buffers around yards with forage hot/cold spots.",
    "Layers for risks (schools, play areas) and access routes.",
    "Printable ‘field map’ and a simple web view."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Import open layers (OSM, canopy, water).",
    "2) Add yard points and buffers; mark hazards and neighbours.",
    "3) Annotate bloom sites and dearth gaps; link scale logs.",
    "4) Use maps in siting and planting decisions; review annually."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Update after droughts/floods/land-use changes.",
    "Winter is good for desk mapping; spring ground-truthing."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Max hive density per km² per forage class (rule-of-thumb).",
    "Distance to water and shade availability."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Low yields -> Add planting near cold spots or reduce hives.",
    "Complaints cluster -> Reroute flight paths; add screens.",
    "Robbing hotspots -> Adjust yard density; change harvest timing."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Overly fancy maps no one reads.",
    "Out-of-date layers when land changes.",
    "No link to actions (planting, hive moves)."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "QGIS or web tools, GPS/phone, simple symbology.",
    "Shared drive with PDFs for offline phones."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Respect private data (neighbours).",
    "Do not publish exact hive coordinates publicly."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Layers current; printouts packed.",
    "Notes from ground truth fed back into map.",
    "Decisions logged against map snapshots."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain buffers (forage radius) visually."
