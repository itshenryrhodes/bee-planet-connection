{
  "At-a-Glance": "Moving bees to follow nectar flows or pollination contracts demands planning, biosecurity, and transport safety.",
  "Why it Matters": "Poorly timed or executed moves cause losses, queen damage, or neighbour issues. Good logistics turn miles into yield.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Pre-move health check and records; secure pallets/straps; ventilate hives; close entrances at dusk, load in the cool; plan routes, rest stops, and site access; open entrances at destination after settling. Coordinate with growers for spray windows and water.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Hot spells require extra ventilation and water; avoid midday moves. In cold snaps, protect from chilling and secure lids/straps.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Under-strapping, blocked ventilation, ignoring local movement rules, and failing to notify landowners.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Pallets, straps, screens, moving nets, dollies/telehandlers, route plans, permits/insurance.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Consult transport regulations and pollination codes of practice for your jurisdiction.",
  "Notes": ""
