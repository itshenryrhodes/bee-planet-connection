  "At-a-Glance": "Map bloom calendars and fill gaps with planters, community beds, and tree advocacy. Pair with hive count discipline.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Reduces dearth stress and robbing.",
    "Improves community perception and biodiversity."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Build a local bloom/dearth calendar.",
    "Select gap-filling plants by season and scale.",
    "Coordinate with neighbours and councils."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Street trees + planters + pocket meadows staggered by season.",
    "Bee/wildlife-friendly species, not just honey-bee favourites.",
    "Hives sized to carrying capacity."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Record blooms for a year; add hive scale notes.",
    "2) Identify gap months; shortlist species for pots/beds/trees.",
    "3) Pitch small projects to sites; set watering/maintenance.",
    "4) Review outcomes; adjust hive counts or plantings."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Heat/drought favour tough perennials and mulch.",
    "Late frosts reset early plans—diversify species."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Gap weeks per year; dearth weight loss rates.",
    "Plant survival and flowering success rates."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Planter fails -> Wrong soil/water; switch species or steward.",
    "Wasp spikes -> Move sugary plants away from entrances.",
    "Poor public response -> Add signage and joint ownership."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Planting without maintenance plan.",
    "Single-season fixes; no winter forage.",
    "Overstocking hives vs available forage."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Bloom logs, community mapping, drought-proof planters.",
    "Mulch, timers, and steward rota."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Permissions for planting; weight limits on roofs/balconies.",
    "Avoid invasive species; check lists."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Gap calendar updated.",
    "Species list agreed.",
    "Watering and stewardship assigned."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Share ‘why these plants’ and ‘who waters’ clearly."
