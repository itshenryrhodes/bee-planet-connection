  "At-a-Glance": "Thymol products need warmth and good brood nest airflow. Dose steadily; avoid honey taint period on market supers.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Useful shoulder-season option.",
    "Lower risk when used within temperature band."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Apply within labelled temperature range.",
    "Keep supers for sale off during treatment.",
    "Schedule two-phase courses where required."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Steady release over full course duration.",
    "Bees can ventilate; entrances not overly reduced.",
    "Post-course sampling shows reduction."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Check forecast; confirm band (often warm, not hot).",
    "2) Place trays/gel per instructions; avoid spill.",
    "3) Re-dose mid-course if product requires.",
    "4) Verify reduction; wait taint interval before supering."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Shoulder seasons ideal; too cool reduces release.",
    "Hot spells can agitate colonies."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Course duration and re-dose timing.",
    "Verification sampling targets."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Low effect -> Too cool or short course; adjust next round.",
    "Agitation -> Increase airflow; check placement."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Supering too soon after course.",
    "Under-dosing or cutting course short.",
    "Blocking airflow excessively."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Thymol trays/gels, timer reminders, sampling kit.",
    "Spacers for airflow if crowded."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Follow label and food taint guidance.",
    "Record batch and dates."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Temp band OK; supers off for market honey.",
    "Dose placed; mid-course plan set.",
    "Post-course sampling scheduled."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain taint intervals to the team clearly."
