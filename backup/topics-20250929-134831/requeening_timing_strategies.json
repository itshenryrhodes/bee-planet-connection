  "At-a-Glance": "Time requeens to mating windows and flow calendar; match method (caged, nuc combine, brood break) to conditions.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Raises acceptance and winter survival.",
    "Aligns temperament and productivity goals."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Choose seasonal windows for best acceptance.",
    "Select method per colony state and resources.",
    "Track acceptance and performance post-requeen."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Spring: boost weak colonies with mated queens.",
    "Late summer: requeen before winter bee rearing.",
    "Hot colonies: nuc combine and split method for safer swaps."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Diagnose colony and set goal (temperament, productivity, disease recovery).",
    "2) Choose method: direct cage, push-in cage, nuc combine, or brood break then intro.",
    "3) Prepare colony: make room, feed lightly, reduce pressure.",
    "4) Introduce; check in 3–7 days; verify new eggs at ~7–10 days."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Avoid heat/dearth peaks unless using nuc-combine method.",
    "Spring cold snaps reduce acceptance—use push-in cages."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Acceptance rate targets by method.",
    "Age policy (e.g., replace >2-year queens proactively)."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Balling risk -> Use push-in cage; add young bees; reduce pheromone competition.",
    "No eggs after 10 days -> Check for virgin; reattempt with nuc-combine.",
    "Chalkbrood after requeen -> Nutrition/ventilation; not queen-only issue."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Introducing into congested/hot colonies.",
    "Not removing emergency cells.",
    "Skipping follow-up checks."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Push-in cages, smoke/water mist, nucs, queen excluder for confinement.",
    "Acceptance checklist and timer reminders."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Mark and clip per policy; handle imports with paperwork.",
    "Transport queens temperature-safe."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Space created; feed ready.",
    "Cells removed; intro method chosen.",
    "Post-check scheduled."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain why late-summer requeens aid winter readiness."
