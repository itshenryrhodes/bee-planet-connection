  "Why it Matters": [
    "Improves survival and reduces management input.",

  "Objectives": [
    "Assess yard goals: temperament, wintering, swarm tendency, honey profile.",
    "Source queens from local breeders and occasional outside lines.",
    "Track performance to guide requeening and breeding."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Mostly local stock with periodic diverse lines to refresh genes.",
    "Records linking queen source to outcomes.",
    "Clear cull/keep rules based on behaviour and productivity."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Define traits and thresholds; share with suppliers.",
    "2) Requeen poor performers; propagate from best.",
    "3) Test small batches of imports; avoid yard-wide switches.",
    "4) Review annually; update sources."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Late summer requeening aligns with winter-bee raising.",
    "Harsh winters favour conservative brood cycles."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Temper score, honey yield, mite levels, spring build metrics.",
    "Cull thresholds for temperament and brood pattern."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Hot yard -> Cull queens; add local gentle lines.",
    "Symptom: Poor winter survival -> Shift to proven local stock; adjust feed/comb plan.",
    "Symptom: Inbreeding signs -> Introduce unrelated drones/queens."
