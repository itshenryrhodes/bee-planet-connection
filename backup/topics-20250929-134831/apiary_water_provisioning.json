  "At-a-Glance": "Provide reliable, safe water near hives to keep bees off neighbours’ pools and to support cooling and brood food.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Reduces complaints and forager stress.",
    "Supports colony thermoregulation in heat waves."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Install shallow, grippy waterers with refresh schedule.",
    "Site water upwind/sunny to attract early.",
    "Add minerals lightly where appropriate."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Trays with pebbles/corrugated float; slow-drip barrels for refill.",
    "First water source discovered is yours; placed before heat spikes.",
    "Algae managed with scrub/refresh; no drowning slicks."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Set waterers 3–10 m from hives, sunny spot to attract.",
    "2) Add texture: pebbles, cork, mesh; keep depth <2 cm in trays.",
    "3) Prime with light salt/mineral hint; refresh 2–3×/week in heat.",
    "4) Move gradually if needed; keep path tidy and non-slip."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Heat waves need larger capacity and shade.",
    "Freezing winters require shallow black tubs or de-icers (where safe)."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Refresh frequency by temp/humidity; algae growth watch.",
    "Neighbour complaint count pre/post installation."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Bees still at pools -> Increase sun/odor cue; move earlier in season.",
    "Drowning -> Add more floats; reduce depth; clean slime.",
    "Wasps dominate -> Relocate slightly; add decoy away from entrances."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Deep slick surfaces; no grip.",
    "Setting water after bad habits formed.",
    "Letting algae mats build—bees slip."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Float materials (cork, mesh), slow-drip barrels, scrub brushes.",
    "Simple mineral mix (tiny pinch of sea salt) if local water is very soft."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Avoid chemical algicides near food production.",
    "Safe carrying routes; slip-resistant mats."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Waterers placed and labelled.",
    "Refresh schedule in calendar.",
    "Floats/pebbles cleaned and reset."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Tell neighbours you’ve provided water—invite feedback."
