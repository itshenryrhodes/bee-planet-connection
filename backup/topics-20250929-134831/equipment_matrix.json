  "At-a-Glance": "A simple matrix lists what boxes, frames, and tools you own, where they are, and their condition—ending ‘where is that?’ panic.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Saves time and duplicate purchases.",
    "Supports maintenance planning and batch traceability."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Create an equipment register by site and condition.",
    "Track consumables and reorder triggers.",
    "Plan renewals and standardise SKUs."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Spreadsheet/app with counts, sizes, locations, condition, next actions.",
    "Standardised frame type and box sizes to reduce chaos.",
    "Colour tags for repair/scrap decisions."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Inventory: walk each site and store; count and rate.",
    "2) Standardise: choose frame sizes and box types; deprecate oddities.",
    "3) Reorder levels: set min/max for frames, foundation, lids.",
    "4) Review quarterly; tie into season plan (splits/supers)."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Pre-spring build and post-harvest reviews catch shortages.",
    "Weather losses feed back into reorder levels."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Red/amber/green status per item.",
    "Trigger levels for automatic reorder."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Last-minute shortages -> Raise mins; add calendar reminders.",
    "Symptom: Piles of broken gear -> Scrap rule; repair day scheduled.",
    "Symptom: Mixed frame types -> Standardise and sell off surplus."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "No owner for the register.",
    "Mixing foundation/frame types across yards."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Shared sheet/app; QR tags; simple codes on boxes.",
    "Annual ‘repair day’ with parts kits."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Store gear dry and safe from rodents.",
    "Log repairs that affect food contact surfaces."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Register updated.",
    "Mins met before spring.",
    "Broken items tagged."
