  "At-a-Glance": "Walk-away splits are fast but variable; controlled splits manage queen cells, timing, and outcomes—choose based on goals.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Expands apiary and relieves swarm pressure.",
    "Matching method to season improves success."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Define goals (increase count vs selective improvement).",
    "Use controlled splits when genetics/timing matter.",
    "Track outcomes by method to refine SOP."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Walk-away: equalising bees/brood; both halves can raise queen.",
    "Controlled: queenright half + queenless half with chosen QC or introduced queen.",
    "Follow-ups scheduled for cell culling and mating checks."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Choose method; prep boxes and stands.",
    "2) Allocate brood, food, and bees fairly; avoid moving the queen by mistake.",
    "3) For controlled: select best open QC or add caged queen.",
    "4) Recheck at day 7/14; feed as needed; log outcomes."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Best during strong nectar/queen mating windows.",
    "Avoid long dearths or poor weather forecasts."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Minimum frames of bees/brood per split.",
    "Success rate target per method by month."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Queenless signs -> Provide frame with eggs or introduce queen.",
    "Multiple casts -> Reduce to one QC; adjust entrances.",
    "Weak halves -> Combine or boost with emerging brood."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Accidentally moving queen to wrong half.",
    "Leaving too many cells leading to casts.",
    "Underfeeding during poor weather."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Queen clips, frame cages, feeders, entrance reducers.",
    "Paint dot/marker for QC selection."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Site permissions for new stands.",
    "Transport safely if moving splits."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Method chosen and recorded.",
    "QC selection done (controlled only).",
    "Follow-ups in calendar."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "State goal up front so helpers don’t mix methods."
