  "At-a-Glance": "A simple bloom calendar informs supering, splits, feeding, and marketing stories.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Better timing yields better honey and calmer bees.",
    "Creates content for labels and education."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "List key nectar/pollen sources by month.",
    "Note timing shifts due to weather and microclimate.",
    "Link to scale data and actions."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Month-by-month table with local notes and photos.",
    "Actions column: super, split, feed, move, market story.",
    "Annual revision after season review."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Draft calendar from experience and local guides.",
    "2) Validate with weight logs and field notes.",
    "3) Add photos and stories; publish to team.",
    "4) Update post-season with real dates and outcomes."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Early springs advance trees; drought shortens herb blooms.",
    "Ivy dominates late—plan accordingly."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Daily weight delta triggers in calendar.",
    "Moisture targets and extraction windows noted."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Issue: Missed flow -> Check calendar lag; adjust next year; add alerts.",
    "Issue: Dearth unknown -> Add gap species; shift splits earlier.",
    "Issue: Marketing mismatch -> Align labels to bloom stories."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Copying national calendars without local tweaks.",
    "No photos or dates from own yards.",
    "Forgetting pollen sources vs nectar."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Shared sheet, photos, QR codes to plant IDs.",
    "Scale dashboards tied to months."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Avoid trespass for photos/foraging checks.",
    "Do not publish precise hive locations without consent."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Calendar printed in truck.",
    "Weight and bloom notes captured.",
    "Post-season review scheduled."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Share monthly ‘what’s blooming’ posts."
