  "At-a-Glance": "Choose single vs double brood (or 14x12) based on forage, climate, and management style—then commit to a clear frame plan.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Right volume reduces swarming and improves overwintering.",
    "Consistent configs simplify training and inventory."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Match brood volume to colony genetics and flows.",
    "Define frame cycle and queen excluder practices.",
    "Document when/how to switch configurations."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Single brood with aggressive supering in strong flows.",
    "Double brood for prolific lines or late heather prep.",
    "14x12 for fewer boxes in cool regions; frame plan posted."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Map local flows/overwinter needs; choose default configuration.",
    "2) Train on frame patterns and where to place stores/brood.",
    "3) Review in mid-season; switch only with a plan and spares.",
    "4) Standardise boxes/frames across yards to reduce chaos."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Cold regions benefit from larger brood or deeper frames.",
    "Long dearths reward compact nests to reduce consumption."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Frames of brood target by month.",
    "Swarm indicator thresholds (capped brood area + congestion)."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Chronic backfilling -> More brood volume or earlier supering.",
    "Underperforming doubles -> Consolidate to single; cull poor queen.",
    "Comb mangement mess -> Re-train; adopt frame map cards."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Mixing configs within the same yard without labels.",
    "Switching mid-flow causing chaos.",
    "No drawn comb inventory to support chosen config."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Frame maps, coloured pins, standardised excluders and spacers.",
    "Inventory sheet for drawn comb."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Manual handling—doubles get heavy; plan two-person lifts.",
    "Consistent labelling to prevent cross-yard swaps."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Default config chosen per yard.",
    "Frame maps printed.",
    "Drawn comb stock checked."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain ‘why this config here’ so helpers stay consistent."
