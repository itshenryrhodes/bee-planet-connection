  "At-a-Glance": "Seed with fine crystals, hold at steady cool temps, and avoid moisture shocks to make smooth, spreadable honey.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Adds premium SKU and extends shelf variety.",
    "Rescues coarse-set honey into a desirable format."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Prepare fine seed and mix precisely.",
    "Control temperature curve for consistent texture.",
    "Package without introducing condensation."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Seed 5–10% w/w from micro-fine batch; gentle paddle mix.",
    "Set at ~13–14 °C for a week (method dependent).",
    "Jars filled cool; lids on; bloom minimal."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Make/buy seed with ultra-fine crystals; store cool and dry.",
    "2) Warm base honey to pourable (not hot); add seed; mix evenly.",
    "3) Hold at target temp undisturbed; check set after 5–7 days.",
    "4) Jar when semi-firm or fully set (process dependent); store cool."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Summer rooms may need dedicated cool cabinet.",
    "Winter condensation risks—temper jars and room."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Seed ratio 5–10% typical; temperature accuracy ±1 °C.",
    "Moisture ≤18% before seeding."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Gritty texture -> Improve seed fineness or ratio; mix better.",
    "Symptom: Separation -> Moisture too high or heat cycles; rework.",
    "Symptom: Bloom/frosting -> Lower jar temp swings; avoid fridge."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Using coarse-set as seed.",
    "Warm/cold cycling during set.",
    "Open jars in humid rooms."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Paddle mixer, cool cabinet, seed stock, temp logger.",
    "Jar warming/tempering rack."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Food-safe mixers and seals; cleaning between batches.",
    "Accurate label description (‘soft set’)."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Seed ready and logged.",
    "Room at target temp.",
    "Jars tempered; lids staged."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain ‘soft-set’ to avoid ‘sugar added’ myths."
