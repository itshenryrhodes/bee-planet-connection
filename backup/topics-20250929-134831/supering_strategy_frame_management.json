  "At-a-Glance": "Add the right space at the right time. Manage frame count, drawn comb, and queen excluders to hit flow peaks without swarming.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Maximises yield and reduces swarming.",
    "Improves honey moisture and capping quality."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Define supering triggers from weight/forage cues.",
    "Stage drawn comb ahead of flows; manage excluders wisely.",
    "Align extraction windows with moisture targets."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Decision card: add super at weight delta or bloom cue.",
    "Drawn comb topmost; wet supers returned post-extraction to clean up.",
    "Excluder used when needed; not hindering early build."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Watch scales and bloom; trigger supering at agreed thresholds.",
    "2) Place drawn comb above; foundation framed between drawn when needed.",
    "3) Manage excluder: on for harvest purity; remove if impeding build.",
    "4) Pull when mostly capped or moisture OK; return wet supers to clean."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Cold springs slow draw—delay heavy foundation-only supers.",
    "Heat waves raise moisture risk—improve ventilation."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Daily weight gain trigger (e.g., +1–2 kg/day sustained).",
    "Pull target: ≥80–90% capping or ≤18% moisture."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Backfilling brood -> Add space now; relieve with drawn comb.",
    "Symptom: Bridge comb mess -> Re-space; ensure frames tight; level hives.",
    "Symptom: High moisture -> Delay pull; dry room; improve ventilation."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Adding too late or with only foundation during flow.",
    "Excluder blocking in cool snaps.",
    "No post-extraction clean-up plan."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Hive scales, refractometer, bee escapes, triangle boards.",
    "Spare drawn comb inventory."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Safe lifting and carrying; team lifts for heavy supers.",
    "Food-contact handling for wet supers."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Triggers met; supers staged.",
    "Drawn comb allocated.",
    "Moisture and capping recorded."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain timing logic so helpers act consistently."
