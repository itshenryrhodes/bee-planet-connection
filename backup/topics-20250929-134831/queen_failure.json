  "At-a-Glance": "Spot failing queens early—patchy brood, drone layers, hot behaviour—and have a plan: requeen, combine, or allow a controlled raise.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Prevents lost flows and winter failures.",
    "Reduces swarming and temperament issues."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Diagnose queen issues vs disease or nutrition.",
    "Choose the right remedy based on season and stock.",
    "Record outcomes to inform breeding and suppliers."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Clear brood pattern criteria and photos.",
    "Requeen schedule aligned to mating windows.",
    "Nucs on standby for quick swaps."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Confirm symptoms: pattern, eggs, temperament, age, mites.",
    "2) Decide: introduce mated queen, allow cell, or unite with nuc.",
    "3) Execute with slow release and smoke control; protect during dearth.",
    "4) Verify laying pattern after 1–2 weeks; log supplier/line."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Late summer requeens settle well before winter.",
    "Poor mating weather increases risk—prefer mated queens."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Pattern floor (e.g., ≤70% coverage triggers action).",
    "Age-based pre-emptive requeen policy."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Scattered drone brood -> Laying worker or failed mating; combine then requeen.",
    "Good queen but scant stores -> Feed/support; reassess.",
    "Aggressive yard -> Cull multiple queens; bring in gentle line."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Blaming queen for mite/virus issues.",
    "Introducing into hot, crowded colonies without space.",
    "No backup queens ready."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Queen cages/candy, push-in cages, nucs, newspaper combine.",
    "Pattern photo cards for training."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Mark dates/IDs; supplier trace.",
    "Local import/movement rules."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Diagnosis confirmed.",
    "Replacement path chosen.",
    "Post-intro check scheduled."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain to learners the difference between queen fault and colony stress."
