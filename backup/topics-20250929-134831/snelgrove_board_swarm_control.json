  "At-a-Glance": "A Snelgrove board splits flyers and nurses with controllable entrances—powerful, flexible swarm control and queen rearing tool.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Controls swarming while maintaining honey production.",
    "Allows timed recombination or parallel queen rearing."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Install board correctly and manage entrance schedule.",
    "Direct flyers where needed to reduce pressure.",
    "Complete follow-ups to prevent casts."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Lower: queenright with main entrance; Upper: queen cell(s) with phased entrances.",
    "Entrance change schedule posted on hive.",
    "Final unite or dual production planned."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Prepare: identify queen and swarm cells; place Snelgrove board with shutters closed.",
    "2) Queenright brood below; QC(s) above with feed if needed.",
    "3) Open designated upper entrance opposite lower; switch per schedule to bleed flyers down.",
    "4) Inspect at day 7/14; reduce to one QC; later unite or run as two units."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Spring build-up and early flow.",
    "Windy sites: secure tall stacks and boards."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Entrance switch schedule (e.g., days 1, 4, 7).",
    "Cell emergence/mating windows noted."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Upper gets weak -> Feed and adjust entrances.",
    "Cast risk -> Reduce to one QC; ensure flyers are bleeding to lower.",
    "Queenless outcomes -> Recombine or introduce queen."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Wrong entrance opened—confuses flight paths.",
    "Leaving multiple cells above.",
    "Forgetting to post switch schedule."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Snelgrove board, entrance markers, schedule card.",
    "Straps/anchors for tall stacks."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Ladder/stack safety; team lifts.",
    "Neighbour awareness for changed flight paths."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Board fitted, shutters identified.",
    "Schedule posted.",
    "Day-7 check booked."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Teach the ‘bleed flyers down’ concept with drawings."
