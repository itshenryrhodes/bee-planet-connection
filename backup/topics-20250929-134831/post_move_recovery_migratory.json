  "At-a-Glance": "After transport, stabilise colonies quickly: ventilation, water, space, and a calm first inspection prevent setbacks that erase the value of moving.",
  "Why it Matters": "Heat, vibration, and confinement stress queens and nurse bees. Recovery protocols preserve brood viability and foraging readiness.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Unload in the cool; level and space pallets; open entrances progressively; provide immediate water. Within 24â€“48 hours verify queen-rightness and brood pattern on a sample; add space if flows are on; feed lightly if thin. Note any grower spray notices and set monitoring cadence.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "High heat demands extra ventilation and water; cold snaps call for windbreaks and conservative openings.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Full inspections on day one, parking in wind tunnels, and failing to document issues for grower/insurer follow-up.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Straps, screens, waterers, shade, spare supers/frames, concise post-move checklist.",
  "Notes": ""
