  "At-a-Glance": "Pollen drives brood. Track incoming pollen colour/volume and support during gaps without overusing substitutes.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Protein availability governs brood and immunity.",
    "Gaps increase disease and DWV risk."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Observe/record pollen inflow and colours.",
    "Stage frames of stored pollen where ethical/legal.",
    "Use substitutes sparingly and effectively."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Pollen ring around brood; steady nurse bee behaviour.",
    "Nucs receive frames with bands of bee bread.",
    "Sub use tied to clear deficit and then stopped."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Note daily pollen inflow at entrance and frame bands.",
    "2) During gaps: move frames with pollen; consider sub.",
    "3) Reassess brood/pollen balance weekly; stop supports when flow resumes.",
    "4) Track results alongside mite management."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Spring cold snaps interrupt pollen; support nucs.",
    "Late summer droughts reduce diversity—watch brood stress."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Frames with pollen bands per brood box.",
    "Sub usage and brood response."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Brood stall + low pollen -> Support; check for dearth causes.",
    "Plenty of pollen but brood weak -> Queen/mites/disease issue.",
    "Chalkbrood after rain -> Improve ventilation and warmth."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Treating every slowdown as nutrition-only.",
    "Leaving sub on too long—mould/robbers.",
    "Ignoring diversity—mono pollen isn’t enough."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Entrance observation sheet, frame photos, small sub patties.",
    "Freezer retains of pollen frames where allowed."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Local regulations on subs/ingredients.",
    "Avoid contamination with treatment chemicals."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Inflow observed; frames checked.",
    "Support chosen and logged.",
    "Stop date planned."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Teach ‘pollen drives brood’ with real frames."
