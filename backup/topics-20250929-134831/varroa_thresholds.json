  "Why it Matters": [
    "Prevents late, ineffective treatments.",
    "Aligns decisions across multiple beekeepers."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Define trigger bands for growth, harvest, and winter prep.",
    "Tie thresholds to specific products and methods.",
    "Review annually against outcomes."

  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "One sheet with per-100 and drop thresholds by month.",
    "Green-amber-red action bands posted in the truck.",
    "Post-treatment checks scheduled."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Choose default sampling method and units.",
    "2) Agree seasonal triggers for each yard profile.",
    "3) Map actions to triggers with products and constraints.",
    "4) Review outcomes and tweak bands annually."

  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Brood cycles shift thresholds; heat limits some products.",
    "Late flows change timingâ€”plan alternatives."

  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Trigger hit during heat wave -> Switch to permitted option or delay safely.",
