  "At-a-Glance": "Bee escapes and clearer boards move bees down gently for clean super pulls without excessive brushing or shaking.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Faster harvests with less stress and fewer stings.",
    "Cleaner frames reduce debris in the honey room."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Choose the right escape/board for colony strength and weather.",
    "Time installations to avoid robbing and cold nights.",
    "Verify clear and pull promptly."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Clearer board fitted late afternoon; supers off next morning.",
    "Minimal bees left; quick brush at stack only.",
    "No open honey exposed; lids on stacks."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Ensure no brood in supers; fit clearer board/escapes under supers.",
    "2) Seal gaps; reduce entrances if robbing pressure.",
    "3) Return 12–24 h later; pull and stack with lids; strap for transport.",
    "4) Remove board; restore normal entrances."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Cool nights risk chilling—avoid if supers have brood or temps very low.",
    "High robbing seasons require fast, tidy pulls."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Target <5–10% bees remaining in supers.",
    "If still busy after 24 h, check for brood/queen in supers."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Poor clearing -> Leaks/warped boards or brood present; fix and retry.",
    "Symptom: Robbing during pull -> Tighten entrances; cover stacks; speed up.",
    "Symptom: Bees back up through board -> Wrong orientation; check arrows."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Leaving boards on for days, causing congestion below.",
    "Pulling during peak flight and spilling honey."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Porter escapes, triangle/maze clearers, spare lids and sheets, bee brush.",
    "Stack covers and straps."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Lift safely; watch for wasps at stacks.",
    "Transport with lids/straps to avoid leaks and bees in vehicles."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Boards/escapes clean and oriented.",
    "No brood in supers; entrances set.",
    "Pull scheduled and team briefed."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain timing: fit late, pull early."
