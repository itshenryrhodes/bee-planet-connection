  "At-a-Glance": "Vespa velutina (Asian hornet) predates foragers and can destabilise colonies. Early detection, accurate ID, and coordinated reporting are essential.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Predation reduces foraging and can trigger colony shutdown near nests.",
    "Rapid, accurate reporting supports official containment/eradication efforts.",
    "False positives waste resources; clear ID and evidence matter."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Train visual ID vs native species; collect photo/video evidence.",
    "Deploy targeted monitoring (bait stations/observation) in risk windows.",
    "Know the exact national reporting channel and required details."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Clear photos (side and dorsal) showing yellow leg socks and dark abdomen.",
    "Bait stations monitored responsibly; no indiscriminate trapping of natives.",
    "Swift submission to official reporting app/portal with location metadata."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Learn ID markers vs European hornet and other wasps.",
    "2) Set observation points near apiaries; log dates/times/weather.",
    "3) If suspected: obtain clear photos/video; do not attempt nest removal.",
    "4) Report immediately via national channel; follow guidance for tracking.",
    "5) Coordinate with local beekeepers; stand down traps when advised."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Spring queens emerge; late summer–autumn worker pressure often highest.",
    "Warm, sheltered areas and transport hubs show higher risk."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Photo evidence with GPS timestamp accelerates response.",
    "Multiple sightings within days may indicate nest proximity."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Hawking at hive entrance -> Confirm ID with photo -> Report; consider entrance screens and shade cloth to disrupt flight.",
    "Symptom: Repeated single sightings -> Increase observation cadence; coordinate with neighbours.",
    "Symptom: Trap bycatch issues -> Switch to observation-led monitoring; review lure type."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Homemade kill traps harming native species.",
    "Chasing or attacking nests without PPE/expertise.",
    "Reporting without usable evidence."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "ID cards, binoculars, macro-capable phone camera.",
    "Selective bait stations; entrance screens to slow hawking.",
    "Shared map/app to coordinate sightings."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Do not approach nests; stings can be severe.",
    "Follow national eradication protocols; preserve evidence safely."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "ID quick guide in kit.",
    "Phone charged for photos/GPS.",
    "Reporting link saved; incident notes template ready."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Calm, factual updates prevent panic and support accurate responses."
