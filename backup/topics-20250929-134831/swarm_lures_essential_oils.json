  "At-a-Glance": "Synthetic Nasonov mimics and lemongrass-based lures boost bait hive success when matched with the right box volume and siting.",
  "Why it Matters": "Well-designed traps intercept local swarms, reduce nuisance calls, and provide low-cost increase from local genetics.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Use ~40L dark interior boxes with a small entrance. Add one old brood frame for scent. Apply a minimal lure dose to avoid overpowering odours. Mount 3â€“5m high, level, shaded morning sun, entrance facing SE. Inspect weekly; relocate caught swarms at dusk.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Pre-position traps a few weeks before your regional swarm peak. Refresh lures per manufacturer guidance; heat volatilises quickly.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Over-luring (repellent), huge entrances, and unstable mounts. Replace old, mouse-scented equipment.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Bait boxes, old comb, lemongrass/Nasonov lures, straps, ladder/safe access, transport box.",
  "Notes": ""
