  "At-a-Glance": "Choose feeders that match the job: rapid, contact, frame, or top. Prevent drownings and robbing; label volumes and clean often.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Efficient feeding builds nucs and saves weak colonies.",
    "Poor feeders cause drownings and fights."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Standardise 1–2 feeder types per yard.",
    "Write fill/clean/close SOP with timings.",
    "Track volumes and outcomes."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Float systems that prevent drowning; lids tight; no leaks.",
    "Fill at dusk or early; zero syrup drips.",
    "Volumes matched to goal (stim vs bulk)."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Pick types per use: frame (nucs), top (bulk), contact jars (gentle).",
    "2) Fit reducers/robber screens before feeding.",
    "3) Mix and label syrup; fill cleanly; wipe spills.",
    "4) Monitor take-up; remove when done; clean/dry."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Cool weather favours internal contact feeders.",
    "Heat expands syrup—allow headspace to avoid overflow."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Stim feed volumes vs brood response.",
    "Target zero drownings; log exceptions."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Bees drowning -> Add floats/mesh; check tilt.",
    "Robbing at lids -> Switch times; improve seals; reduce entrances.",
    "Mould -> Shorter fill cycles; sanitise more often."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Overfilling top feeders that then leak.",
    "Open buckets near hives.",
    "No records linking feed to outcomes."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Mesh floats, tight lids, marked jugs, funnels.",
    "Disinfectant safe for food gear."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Food-safe containers; label sugar sources.",
    "Do not contaminate honey supers."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Reducers on; screens ready.",
    "Syrup mixed and labelled.",
    "Towels/bucket for spills in truck."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain ‘stim vs bulk’ to new helpers."
