  "At-a-Glance": "Extreme heat stresses bees and can melt comb. Shade, ventilation, and water access prevent losses during heat waves.",
  "Why it Matters": "Overheated hives divert foragers to fanning and water hauling, reducing nectar intake and risking brood collapse and queen failure.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Provide afternoon shade or temporary covers; increase ventilation with top shims or extra entrances; ensure constant clean water close to hives; avoid heavy inspections midday; consider moving dark roofs to reflective lids; prevent comb sag by maintaining frame spacing and avoiding tilted hives.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Prolonged hot spells and warm nights compound stress; urban heat islands can be several degrees hotter than rural yards.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Sealing hives too tightly, removing too much space (overcrowding), or failing to provide water within easy flight distance.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Waterers with floats/stones, shade cloth, ventilated floors/crownboards, thermometer/data loggers, and reflective roofing.",
  "Notes": ""
