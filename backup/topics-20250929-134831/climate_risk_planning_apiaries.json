  "At-a-Glance": "Plan for heatwaves, storms, drought, and floods. Build site resilience with siting, equipment, forage, and operations.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Extreme weather increases losses and costs.",
    "Thoughtful planning protects bees and business."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Map climate risks per site and set triggers for actions.",
    "Prepare kits and SOPs for heat, wind, and flood events.",
    "Adapt forage plantings and water access."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Risk register per apiary with thresholds (temp, wind, rain).",
    "Go-bags: straps, shade cloths, water gear ready.",
    "Post-event review and improvements."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Assess: flood maps, wind exposure, shade, water, access routes.",
    "2) Prepare: straps, shade, insulation, raised stands; emergency contacts.",
    "3) Triggers: define temps/winds for actions (shade on, entrances widened, move boxes).",
    "4) Recover: after event, check queen status, stores, varroa, and moisture.",
    "5) Iterate: update register and kit lists."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Heatwaves: shade/water; Winter storms: straps and insulation.",
    "Drought: water + forage gap mitigation."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Trigger examples: >30 Â°C sustained -> add shade/water; >50 mph gusts -> double-strap.",
    "Site-specific action lists recorded and reviewed."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Heat bearding -> Shade + ventilation; add water; reduce disturbance.",
    "Symptom: Flood alerts -> Raise stands or evacuate to alternate site.",
    "Symptom: Drought dearth -> Feed internally; plan forage plantings."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "No pre-packed kit for rapid response.",
    "Ignoring site-specific wind channels and runoff.",
    "Not reviewing after near-misses."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Shade cloth, waterers, straps, weights, moisture quilts.",
    "Risk register template; weather alert apps."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Do not access flooded or storm-damaged sites without clearance.",
    "Manual handling limits enforced in heat."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Risk register current.",
    "Kit inspected and staged.",
    "Trigger thresholds noted and shared."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Send pre-heatwave checklist to helpers the day before."
