> **At a Glance:** Comb honey requires strong flows, gentle handling, and immaculate cappings. Choose method (cut-comb, sections, rounds) and prep ahead.

## Why it Matters
- Premium product with strong margins.
- Signals purity and low-processing to customers.

## Objectives
- Match method to forage and temperature.
- Stage foundation and spacing to encourage straight, white comb.
- Handle and pack without fingerprints or crush.

## What Good Looks Like
- Drawn in heavy nectar with young bees; minimal smoke.
- Straight comb built on thin foundation/wireless frames.
- Cut and packed with gloves, clear labels, airtight boxes.

## Step-by-Step
1) Prepare thin foundation/sections ahead of flow; level hives.
2) Provide space above brood; avoid excessive smoke/propane.
3) Pull promptly when capped; cool room; cut with sterile knife/wire.
4) Drain briefly; pack in crystal-clear clamshells; label and store cool.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Best on strong spring/early summer flows; avoid dearth.
- Heat warps comb; work in cool room.

## Data & Thresholds
- Moisture target similar to liquid harvest; check cappings integrity.
- Reject frames with pollen bands or travel stain.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Wavy/burr comb -> Re-level; improve spacing; use guides.
- Travel stain -> Reduce smoke; pull sooner; handle with gloves.
- Leaky packs -> Cut cleaner; drain longer; upgrade packaging.

## Common Pitfalls
- Trying on weak colonies/weak flows.
- Handling with bare hands—smears and scent.
- Leaving in hive too long—darkens.

## Tools & Techniques
- Thin foundation, sectional racks, hot knife/wire, food-safe gloves.
- Crystal boxes, anti-static cloths, cool storage.

## Safety & Compliance
- Weights/measures; allergen/origin labels.
- Food-safe surfaces and gloves.

## Field Checklist
- Sections prepped and staged.
- Hives level; flow confirmed.
- Packing station clean and cool.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Tell the forage story and ‘no extractors’ simplicity.
