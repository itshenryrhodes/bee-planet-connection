> **At a Glance:** Marking makes queens easy to find and age; clipping one wing helps manage swarming. Done carefully, both reduce inspection time and losses.

## Why it Matters
- Faster queen location shortens inspections and reduces brood chill.
- Colour codes reveal queen age at a glance for requeening plans.
- Clipping can buy time during swarm attempts, keeping bees on site.

## Objectives
- Adopt international year colour codes for consistency.
- Use gentle handling and proper tools to avoid queen injury.
- Record marks, clips, and requeening dates in the hive log.

## What Good Looks Like
- Calm handling with minimal smoke and no crushing.
- Small, centered paint dot on thorax; no paint on wings or spiracles.
- Clean, sharp scissors for a single-wing clip where practiced and desired.

## Step-by-Step
1) Prepare: queen marking cage/tube, paint pen, fine scissors, tissue, spare queen cage.
2) Locate queen with deliberate frame handling; confine workers off her frame edge if needed.
3) Mark: gently restrain in a tube or under a plunger cage; apply small dot to thorax; let dry 30â€“60 seconds.
4) Clip (optional): hold by thorax; trim approx. one third of one forewing; avoid abdomen and legs.
5) Release: place queen back onto brood frame near nurse bees; verify acceptance.
6) Log: colour, clip, date, and any temperament notes.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Best done in warm, calm weather to reduce flight loss.
- Avoid cold snaps or high winds that risk queen flight and loss.

## Data & Thresholds
- Year colours: White (1/6), Yellow (2/7), Red (3/8), Green (4/9), Blue (5/0).
- Re-mark if paint fades or flaked; if uncertain age, note as such in records.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Queen missing after marking -> Check adjacent frames and hive floor -> Minimise smoke and wait; she may hide.
- Symptom: Workers balling queen -> Light smoke, small water mist to disperse -> Reassess colony stress; avoid handling queens in aggressive conditions.
- Symptom: Paint on wings -> Gently remove excess with tissue tip; if heavy, consider caging her briefly until dry.

## Common Pitfalls
- Oversized paint blobs that glue wings or attract attention.
- Clipping both wings or cutting too much, impairing mobility.
- Handling during dearth or storms increasing balling risk.

## Tools & Techniques
- Marking tube or crown-of-thorns cage, quick-dry paint pens, fine scissors.
- Brood frame stand to stabilise work area.
- Head torch for shaded brood areas.

## Safety & Compliance
- Clipping is optional and a management choice; follow local norms and ethics.
- Never use solvents on the queen; allow paint to dry fully before release.

## Field Checklist
- Tools clean and ready.
- Paint pen primed on scrap card.
- Mark colour correct for year.
- Log updated before leaving site.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain colour code to helpers so notes are consistent.

## Further Reading
- Association guides on queen handling and marking.
- Best practice videos from inspectorates and associations.
