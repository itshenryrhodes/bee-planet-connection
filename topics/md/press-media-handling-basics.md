> **At a Glance:** Be press-ready: one story, one spokesperson, good photos, and quick replies. Keep facts tight and claims modest.

## Why it Matters
- Earned media drives trust and stockist leads.
- Crisis comms need prepared statements.

## Objectives
- Write a 150-word boilerplate and 3 talking points.
- Build a tiny press kit: logo, photos, contacts.
- Create holding statements for incidents.

## What Good Looks Like
- Shared doc: facts, dates, names, pronunciation.
- Press inbox monitored; replies within 1 business day.
- Photo folder (landscape/portrait) with credits.

## Step-by-Step
1) Draft boilerplate and talking points (why bees, local forage, quality).
2) Assemble photos: hero, team, apiary, product; credit filenames.
3) Create Q&A for common queries; avoid medical claims.
4) For incidents: acknowledge, state action, provide next update time.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Swarm season attracts media—prep ahead.
- Heatwaves/hornet news: expect interviews; stick to facts.

## Data & Thresholds
- One spokesperson only for live media.
- No off-the-record without explicit agreement.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Leading questions -> Bridge to talking points; be polite.
- Wrong facts spreading -> Post a factual summary; link sources.
- Photo misuse -> Request correction; send approved images.

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-claiming health benefits.
- Meandering origin stories.
- No follow-up with links after interviews.

## Tools & Techniques
- Media sheet template, link shortener, scheduled posts.
- Crisis log with timestamps and decisions.

## Safety & Compliance
- Advertising standards; no medicinal claims.
- Consent for images; child safeguarding at events.

## Field Checklist
- Press kit link ready.
- Spokesperson briefed.
- Follow-up email template loaded.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Thank journalists; share accurate links after broadcast.
