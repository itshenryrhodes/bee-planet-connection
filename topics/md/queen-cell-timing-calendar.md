> **At a Glance:** Queen development is day-precise. A timing calendar keeps grafting, emergence, and mating on rails.

## Why it Matters
- Reduces missed emerges and lost cells.
- Synchronises helpers and equipment.

## Objectives
- Publish a day-by-day schedule (D0 graft → D10 emerge → D14+ mate).
- Align cell builders, mating nucs, and weather windows.
- Track batch outcomes per timing.

## What Good Looks Like
- Shared calendar with batch IDs and milestones.
- Colour-coded stickers on cell bars and cages.
- Contingency windows for poor weather.

## Step-by-Step
1) Set D0 graft from eggs <24 h old or use started cups.
2) D5–D6: check acceptance; D10: incubate/protect emerges.
3) D10–D11: cage virgins or place in mating nucs; avoid chilling.
4) D14–D21: mating checks; log success; recycle failures.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Mating success varies with weather—keep spares.
- Heat/cold require insulated transport for cells/virgins.

## Data & Thresholds
- Acceptance rate target (e.g., ≥80%).
- Mating success target (e.g., ≥70%).

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Poor acceptance -> Check starter strength/larval age; adjust grafting technique.
- Late emerges -> Incubation temp drift; recalibrate.
- Low mating -> Weather or drone supply; boost drone colonies.

## Common Pitfalls
- Losing track of days—cells emerge in pockets.
- Under-supplying drones.
- Handling virgins roughly; chilling.

## Tools & Techniques
- Cell bars, incubator (optional), timing app/labels.
- Drone comb planning and breeder records.

## Safety & Compliance
- Transport rules if sharing across apiaries.
- Hygiene when swapping frames between colonies.

## Field Checklist
- Calendar posted with batch IDs.
- Mating nucs prepped ahead of D10.
- Drone colonies strong and marked.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Teach the D0→D21 milestones with a one-page chart.

## Further Reading
- Queen development day charts.
- Incubation best practices.

## Notes
Print stickers: D0, D5, D10, D14 to tag equipment—prevents calendar mistakes in the field.
