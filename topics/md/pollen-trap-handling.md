> **At a Glance:** Trap sparingly, dry quickly, and store cold and dark. Colony nutrition comes first.

## Why it Matters
- Prevents brood setbacks and hygienic stress.
- Product spoils fast if mishandled.

## Objectives
- Use traps only during strong pollen flows.
- Cleanly collect and rapidly chill or dry.
- Maintain hygiene and traceability.

## What Good Looks Like
- Traps fitted level and cleaned daily; doors open on off-days.
- Pellets collected into clean containers; chilled within hours.
- Batch codes with apiary/date; moisture validated.

## Step-by-Step
1) Confirm strong pollen flow and colony strength; fit trap.
2) Collect daily; remove debris; avoid crushing.
3) Dry ≤40 °C to target moisture or freeze; store opaque/airtight.
4) Rest colonies; remove trap during dearth.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Spring flows best; avoid late-season stress.
- Humidity demands faster drying and sealed storage.

## Data & Thresholds
- Moisture target ≤6–8% for shelf-stable pollen.
- Rest ratio (e.g., 2 on / 5 off days) to protect brood.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Brood thinning -> Reduce trapping; feed substitute if needed.
- Symptom: Off odour -> Discard; improve speed and drying.
- Symptom: Mites in trays -> Improve cleaning and freeze pre-pack.

## Common Pitfalls
- Continuous trapping through dearth.
- Dirty trays and mixed debris.
- Slow drying causing mould.

## Tools & Techniques
- Underfloor/entrance traps, sieves, dehydrator, moisture meter.
- Opaque containers and oxygen absorbers.

## Safety & Compliance
- Food hygiene and allergen labelling for pollen.
- Avoid medical claims.

## Field Checklist
- Trap clean and level.
- Drying/freezing plan ready.
- Batches labelled and logged.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain seasonality and ethical limits to customers.

## Further Reading
- Trapping guides and ethical recommendations.
- Quality standards for bee-collected pollen.
