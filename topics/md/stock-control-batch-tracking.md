> **At a Glance:** Stock control ensures traceability and compliance for honey and wax batches.

## Why it Matters
- Supports food safety audits.
- Improves recall readiness.

## Step-by-Step
1) Assign unique batch codes for each harvest/extraction.
2) Record weights, dates, and treatments linked to the batch.
3) Store records securely for required legal period.

## Common Pitfalls
- Re-using batch codes
- Incomplete treatment records

## Safety & Compliance
Traceability is mandatory under UK/EU food law.
