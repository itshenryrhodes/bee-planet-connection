> **At a Glance:** Clean, temperature-controlled extraction preserves flavour, aroma, and natural enzymes. Plan workflow from super removal to bottling to keep honey pristine and the apiary tidy.

## Why it Matters
- Heat, moisture, and contamination ruin quality and reputation.
- Efficient, hygienic extraction reduces bee robbing and wax moth issues.
- Consistent processes support batch traceability and compliance.

## Objectives
- Remove only ripe supers and protect comb from moisture/odours.
- Maintain a one-way flow: supers → uncapping → extraction → settling → bottling.
- Log batch data: date, apiary, floral notes, moisture, filtration steps.

## What Good Looks Like
- Ripe frames (uncapped cells minimal; refractometer ≤18 percent).
- Warm room (ideally 25–30 °C) to reduce viscosity, not hot.
- Food-grade, sealed vessels; covered strainers; minimal exposure.

## Step-by-Step
1) Pre-check: confirm ripeness with shake test and refractometer.
2) Bee-safe removal: escape boards or gentle brushing; avoid open honey.
3) Uncap: sharp knives/rollers; collect cappings in covered tubs.
4) Extract: balanced load in extractor; slow → fast; avoid comb blow-out.
5) Strain & settle: coarse strain to remove wax; settle 24–48 h to let air rise.
6) Optional fine filtration: minimal to retain character.
7) Bottle: warm (not hot) honey into sterile jars; lids on immediately; label.
8) Clean-down: hot water rinse before residues set; dry equipment thoroughly.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Main rooms may need dehumidifiers in humid climates.
- Cold weather requires pre-warming supers to avoid granulation during spin.

## Data & Thresholds
- Moisture target ≤18 percent (heather/unique varietals may differ).
- Settling time 24–48 hours reduces microbubbles and foam.
- Temperature: keep below ~40 °C to protect enzymes and aroma.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Fermentation tang -> Check moisture; blend with drier batch or dehumidify before bottling.
- Symptom: Persistent foam -> Extend settling; skim gently; check for air leaks in pump/lines.
- Symptom: Cloud complaints -> Educate on natural crystallisation; produce a soft-set line.

## Common Pitfalls
- Extracting unripe honey in damp rooms.
- Overheating to mask high moisture.
- Open cappings attracting robbers; sticky floors leading to ants.

## Tools & Techniques
- Refractometer, escape boards, uncapping station, radial/tangential extractor.
- Food-grade buckets with gates, double strainers, settling tank.
- Dehumidifier, warming cabinet (low set-point), jar turntable.

## Safety & Compliance
- Food hygiene standards, allergen and weight labelling, batch codes.
- Slip prevention; electrics protected from moisture.

## Field Checklist
- Ripe frames only.
- Room warm/dry; lids for all tubs.
- Batch sheet started (apiary/date/moisture).
- Clean-down scheduled same day.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain varietal character, pollen presence, and natural set to customers.
