> **At a Glance:** Design the honey room for clean flow: dirty in → clean out, with easy-to-wash surfaces and separate storage.

## Why it Matters
- Reduces contamination and labour.
- Supports consistent compliance checks.

## Objectives
- Map product flow and segregate ‘dirty’ zones.
- Install washable surfaces and easy drainage.
- Standardise cleaning schedules and records.

## What Good Looks Like
- Zoned layout: reception, uncapping/spin, settling, jarring, packing.
- Handwash station and PPE rack at door; pest-proofing fixed.
- Whiteboard with daily clean checklist and batch plan.

## Step-by-Step
1) Sketch flow; remove clutter; install washable tables/splashbacks.
2) Add labelled bins for cappings, wax, waste water.
3) Place hygrometer/thermometer; plan ventilation/dehumidifier.
4) Post cleaning SOPs and train helpers.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Summer dehumidification; winter warming for viscosity control.
- Storms bring mud—double mats and boot policy.

## Data & Thresholds
- Room RH target <60% during extraction.
- Weekly pest checks logged; zero-tolerance for droppings/webbing.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Issue: Condensation -> Increase airflow/dehumidify; insulate cold spots.
- Issue: Ants/wasps -> Seal entry points; improve waste control.
- Issue: Cross-traffic -> Re-route or stagger tasks.

## Common Pitfalls
- One table for everything.
- No handwash within the room.
- Leaky lids stored above open product.

## Tools & Techniques
- Colour-coded cloths, squeegee floors, food-safe sealants.
- Rack systems for buckets and jars.

## Safety & Compliance
- Slip-resistant floors; cable management.
- MSDS for cleaners; food-contact approvals.

## Field Checklist
- Zones signed; flow arrows taped.
- Handwash stocked; PPE available.
- Cleaning log up to date.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Brief visitors and volunteers before entry.

## Further Reading
- Small food premises layout guides.
- Beekeeper forums on room design.
