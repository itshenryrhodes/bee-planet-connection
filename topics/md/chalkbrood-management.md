> **At a Glance:** Chalkbrood (Ascosphaera apis) causes mummified larvae and patchy brood. It flourishes under chill stress and damp conditions.

## Why it Matters
- Reduces brood viability and slows build-up, especially in spring.
- Often responds to simple environmental corrections and comb renewal.

## Objectives
- Identify chalkbrood rapidly and differentiate from other brood issues.
- Correct microclimate and nutrition; improve queen and comb status.
- Track cases yard-wide to spot siting/ventilation patterns.

## What Good Looks Like
- Reduced mummies on entrance board after interventions.
- Tightening brood pattern over 2–3 brood cycles.
- Dry, draft-managed hives with good pollen income.

## Step-by-Step
1) Confirm signs: ‘mummies’ (white/grey/black) in cells or on floor.
2) Improve climate: add insulation above, ensure forward tilt, reduce gaps; avoid over-ventilation chilling brood.
3) Nutrition: ensure pollen; add patties if dearth; reduce stress.
4) Comb & queen: replace darkest brood comb; consider requeening if persistent.
5) Hygiene: remove mummies; avoid spreading debris between hives.
6) Review site: damp shade/wind exposure; reposition if chronic.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Common in cool, damp springs and after cold snaps.
- Maritime climates with condensation risks need extra care.

## Data & Thresholds
- Track mummy counts (entrance board) week-to-week.
- Persistent high counts despite fixes -> escalate queen/comb changes.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Patchy brood plus mummies -> Address chill/damp first -> Then queen/comb.
- Symptom: Repeats in same stand positions -> Site microclimate issue -> Move or add windbreaks/tilt.
- Symptom: Yard-wide blip after storm -> Expect transient rise -> Monitor.

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-ventilating in cool weather.
- Neglecting comb age and brood nest density.
- Assuming meds are required; focus on environment first.

## Tools & Techniques
- Insulation boards, moisture quilts, windbreaks.
- Frame replacement plan; pollen support.

## Safety & Compliance
- Dispose of debris away from entrances.
- Follow biosecurity when moving frames.

## Field Checklist
- Forward tilt and insulation checked.
- Pollen presence confirmed or supplemented.
- Old comb identified for rotation.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain that chalkbrood is a management signal, not a catastrophe.

A temporary entrance reducer can help bees control drafts while population rebounds.
