> **At a Glance:** Collect only what you need, store it safely, and honour consent. Keep a one-page privacy note and a tidy mailing list.

## Why it Matters
- Meets legal requirements and preserves trust.
- Prevents messy spreadsheets and spam complaints.

## Objectives
- Map data you hold (orders, newsletter, events).
- Create a simple retention and access policy.
- Make opt-in/opt-out frictionless and documented.

## What Good Looks Like
- One system of record for mailing list with double opt-in.
- Minimal data on paper; encrypted devices; limited access.
- Clear privacy note on site and at stalls (QR).

## Step-by-Step
1) Audit data sources; delete duplicates and old exports.
2) Draft privacy note: what/why/how long/rights/contact.
3) Set up consent logs; migrate mailing list to single tool.
4) Define breach response and subject access process.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Q4 customer spikes—prepare signup forms and consent text.
- Event season—bring printed privacy notice/QR.

## Data & Thresholds
- Retention periods (orders, mailing, enquiries).
- Response times for access/erasure requests.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Spreadsheet leaks -> Move to list tool; revoke access; notify if required.
- Unsub requests missed -> Automate; check spam folder; manual log.
- Photo consent unclear -> Use signs and opt-out stickers at events.

## Common Pitfalls
- Collecting birthdays and addresses ‘just in case’.
- Multiple unsynchronised lists.
- Shared logins with no revocation plan.

## Tools & Techniques
- List platform with double opt-in, encrypted drives, password manager.
- QR codes to signup and privacy note.

## Safety & Compliance
- Local data protection law basics (GDPR principles).
- Breach logging and notification where required.

## Field Checklist
- One clean list; consent records intact.
- Privacy note published and printable.
- Revocation/offboarding steps documented.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain why you collect the minimum and how to opt out.

## Further Reading
- Micro-business privacy templates.
- Email marketing consent guidance.
