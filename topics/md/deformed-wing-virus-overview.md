> **At a Glance:** DWV rides varroa. Keep mite levels low, avoid stress, and requeen failing colonies to reduce viral impact.

## Why it Matters
- Major driver of winter losses.
- Symptoms scare the public—handle communications carefully.

## Objectives
- Recognise DWV signs vs other issues.
- Link DWV management to mite control and queen quality.
- Document cases and responses.

## What Good Looks Like
- Mite counts low; queens laying solid patterns; nutrition stable.
- Suspect colonies flagged for fast action (treat + requeen plan).
- Photos and batch/treatment data stored.

## Step-by-Step
1) Confirm mite levels and brood status; sample if unknown.
2) Treat if above thresholds; choose active by season.
3) Evaluate queen; replace if pattern poor or relapse likely.
4) Reduce stressors: space, water, forage; consolidate weak colonies.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Autumn DWV spikes common—tighten thresholds.
- Heat/dearth exacerbate stress—support nutrition/water.

## Data & Thresholds
- DWV incident log with pre/post counts.
- Requeen trigger: recurring symptoms despite control.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Crumpled wings + mites high -> Treat now; consider drone cull later.
- Crumpled wings but low mites -> Check sampling; consider other viruses/pesticide hits.
- Relapse -> Requeen; evaluate genetics and yard pressures.

## Common Pitfalls
- Treating virus without checking mites.
- Waiting for ‘perfect’ queen availability.
- Publicly posting alarming images without context.

## Tools & Techniques
- Sampling kit, camera for records, nucs ready for requeening.
- Nutritional support and space management.

## Safety & Compliance
- Accurate records for inspectors or grants.
- Avoid medical claims when communicating.

## Field Checklist
- Counts taken and logged.
- Treatment applied per label.
- Requeen plan set if needed.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain DWV link to mites; show actions and recovery.

## Further Reading
- DWV overviews and management notes.
- Case studies linking mite suppression to DWV decline.
