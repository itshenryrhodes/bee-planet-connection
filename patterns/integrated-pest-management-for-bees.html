  <h1>Integrated Pest Management for Bees</h1>
  <p>IPM is an attitude as much as a toolkit: monitor routinely, prevent where you can, and treat only as needed with a plan for resistance.</p>

  <h2>Core pillars</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> regular mite checks and disease observation. See <a href="/wiki/varroa-monitoring-methods.html">Varroa Monitoring Methods</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> spacing, genetics, brood breaks, hygiene.</li>
    <li><strong>Intervention:</strong> rotate modes of action; time for best efficacy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Building a season plan</h2>
  <p>Map forage flow, swarm control, and treatment windows. Align brood breaks with treatments (e.g., OAV during caging). See <a href="/wiki/varroa-treatment-options.html">Treatment Options</a>.</p>

  <h2>Records that matter</h2>
  <p>Track mite counts, treatments used, and outcomes to guide next year. See <a href="/wiki/record-keeping-for-beekeepers.html">Record Keeping</a>.</p>
