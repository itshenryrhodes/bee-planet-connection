  <h1>Small Hive Beetle: What to Watch For</h1>
  <p><em>Aethina tumida</em> damages colonies by slime-outs and store spoilage. Good apiary hygiene and strong colonies are your best defences.</p>

  <h2>Identification & signs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Adults: small, dark beetles scuttling across frames and under lids.</li>
    <li>Larvae: cream, segmented, often massed in comb with wet, fermenting honey.</li>
    <li>Damage: slimed frames, sour smell, bees abandoning contaminated comb.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Risk factors</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Warm, humid sites; shaded, damp apiaries.</li>
    <li>Weak colonies and excessive space; honey houses with poor sanitation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prevention first</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep colonies appropriately sized for bee coverage.</li>
    <li>Remove burr comb and scraps; extract supers promptly.</li>
    <li>Use ground sanitation around stands; avoid long-term pallet storage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Control options</h2>
  <p>Traps and absorptive pads help knock back adult numbers; aggressive sanitation breaks breeding. If infestation is severe, isolate and salvage uncontaminated frames, freezing what you can. See <a href="/wiki/wax-moth-and-comb-storage.html">Comb Storage</a> for handling vulnerable equipment.</p>

  <h2>What not to do</h2>
  <p>Avoid leaving wet supers lying about or stacking cappings warm; these are magnets for beetles. Keep honey rooms dry and clean.</p>
