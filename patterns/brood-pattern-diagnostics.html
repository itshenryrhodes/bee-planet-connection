  <h1>Brood Pattern Diagnostics</h1>
  <p>A tidy brood pattern tells you more about a colony than any single metric. Reading it well helps you act early, avoid unnecessary treatments, and keep colonies productive.</p>

  <h2>What a healthy pattern looks like</h2>
  <p>In season, expect a compact oval of brood with few empty cells in the middle. Capped worker brood should dominate, with drone brood pushed to edges and lower corners. Occasional “peppering” is normal after emerging workers or where pollen/honey has been backfilled.</p>

  <h2>Common patterns and likely causes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shotgun brood:</strong> scattered empty cells among capped brood. Often <em>varroa</em>-associated removal of sick larvae or a queen past her best. Cross-check mite loads and queen age. See <a href="/wiki/varroa-monitoring-methods.html">Varroa Monitoring Methods</a> and <a href="/wiki/queen-health-and-requeening.html">Queen Health and Requeening</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Backfilled nest:</strong> queen’s laying area filled with nectar/honey, creating gaps. Usually a space/flow issue; add boxes or move frames. See <a href="/wiki/supering-strategies.html">Supering Strategies</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Drone-heavy core:</strong> too many domed cappings near the centre. Suspect a failing queen or laying worker. See <a href="/wiki/laying-workers-and-fixer-strategies.html">Laying Workers and Fixes</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Pollen mosaic:</strong> colourful ring intruding into the brood area after poor weather. Normal if short-lived; persistent mosaics indicate poor queen performance or nutrition. See <a href="/wiki/nutrition-and-pollen-diversity.html">Nutrition and Pollen Diversity</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quick checks before you decide</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Confirm eggs/young larvae on multiple frames; one egg per cell, centred.</li>
    <li>Scan cappings: worker (flat) vs drone (domed), uniformity matters.</li>
    <li>Smell and texture: chalky mummies or ropey larval remains indicate disease. See <a href="/wiki/chalkbrood-diagnosis-and-management.html">Chalkbrood</a> and <a href="/wiki/american-foulbrood-overview.html">American Foulbrood</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Decision tree</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Varroa risk?</strong> If mite loads exceed your seasonal threshold, prioritise control. See <a href="/wiki/varroa-treatment-options.html">Varroa Treatment Options</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Space constraint?</strong> If nectar is backfilling, add space or move stores outward.</li>
    <li><strong>Queen quality?</strong> If eggs are sparse and patterns remain poor for 10–14 days in good forage, prepare to requeen. See <a href="/wiki/requeening-calendar.html">Requeening Calendar</a>.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Field tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Judge patterns on warm, settled days; cold snaps distort the picture.</li>
    <li>Take one photo per inspection to compare shape and density over time.</li>
    <li>Pair observations with notes. See <a href="/wiki/record-keeping-for-beekeepers.html">Record Keeping</a>.</li>
  </ul>
