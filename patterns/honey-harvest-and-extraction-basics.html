  <h1>Honey Harvest and Extraction Basics</h1>
  <p>A clean, calm harvest protects honey quality and keeps colonies settled. Most of it is preparation.</p>

  <h2>Before you lift a super</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Only take frames ≥ 80% capped, or confirm moisture with a refractometer. See <a href="/wiki/honey-moisture-and-refractometers.html">Moisture &amp; Refractometers</a>.</li>
    <li>Clear bees with escape boards or gentle brushing; avoid fume boards near public.</li>
    <li>Stage food-safe tubs and lids; keep the route from apiary to room short.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>In the room</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Uncap cleanly; keep knives warm, not hot.</li>
    <li>Spin at modest speed; avoid aeration and foaming.</li>
    <li>Strain as needed; don’t over-filter if selling as raw honey.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Quality & compliance</h2>
  <p>Mind hygiene, traceability, and accurate labelling. See <a href="/wiki/food-safety-for-honey-packers.html">Food Safety for Honey Packers</a> and <a href="/wiki/honey-grading-and-standards.html">Grading &amp; Standards</a>.</p>

  <h2>After the harvest</h2>
  <p>Let bees clean wet supers briefly, then store dry to prevent wax moth. See <a href="/wiki/wax-moth-and-comb-storage.html">Comb Storage</a>.</p>
