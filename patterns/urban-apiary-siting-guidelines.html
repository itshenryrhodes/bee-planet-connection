  <h1>Urban Apiary Siting Guidelines</h1>
  <p>Cities can be excellent for bees if sites are chosen with neighbours and forage in mind. Good siting avoids complaints and keeps colonies stable.</p>

  <h2>Choosing a spot</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hidden flight paths above head height; plant screens where possible.</li>
    <li>Solid stands, level ground, and secure access.</li>
    <li>Reliable water on site. See <a href="/wiki/water-sources-for-bees.html">Water Sources for Bees</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Neighbour relations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Share a contact number and inspection schedule.</li>
    <li>Manage swarms proactively; place bait hives in spring. See <a href="/wiki/bait-hives-and-swarm-lures.html">Bait Hives and Swarm Lures</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Local rules</h2>
  <p>Check council by-laws and tenancy agreements; some require set-backs or limits on hive numbers. Keep entrances away from paths and play areas.</p>

  <h2>Seasonal considerations</h2>
  <p>Heat islands intensify summer stress; ensure shade and water. Winter winds funnel between buildingsâ€”use screens and good insulation. See <a href="/wiki/hive-insulation-and-ventilation.html">Insulation and Ventilation</a>.</p>
