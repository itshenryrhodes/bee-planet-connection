  <h1>Record Keeping for Beekeepers</h1>
  <p>Short, consistent notes turn instincts into decisions. They also de-stress inspections and reveal patterns youâ€™d otherwise miss.</p>

  <h2>What to record</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Queen status, brood stage, temperament, and space needs.</li>
    <li>Mite counts and disease signs. See <a href="/wiki/varroa-monitoring-methods.html">Varroa Monitoring Methods</a>.</li>
    <li>Forage notes, weather, and weight changes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Keep it lightweight</h2>
  <p>A pre-printed sheet or simple app with checkboxes beats long prose. The goal is comparability across weeks and colonies.</p>

  <h2>Why it pays off</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Improves timing for supering and swarm control. See <a href="/wiki/supering-strategies.html">Supering Strategies</a> and <a href="/wiki/swarm-control.html">Swarm Control</a>.</li>
    <li>Supports IPM planning and treatment rotation. See <a href="/wiki/integrated-pest-management-for-bees.html">IPM for Bees</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Archiving</h2>
  <p>Keep one season folder per apiary; a single photo of the brood pattern each visit complements written notes beautifully.</p>
