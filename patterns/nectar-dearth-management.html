  <h1>Nectar Dearth Management</h1>
  <p>During a dearth, colonies become edgy, robbing risks rise, and brood areas contract. Small, steady interventions keep everything calm until forage returns.</p>

  <h2>Spotting a dearth early</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Foragers drift and search; washboard behaviour increases.</li>
    <li>Hive weights flatten or fall; nectar drying slows.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Stabilise the colony</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce entrances and tidy yard spillages.</li>
    <li>Avoid tearing open nectar frames; work quickly and late in the day.</li>
    <li>Consider light feeding if brood is at risk. See <a href="/wiki/feeding-strategies.html">Feeding Strategies</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prevent robbing</h2>
  <p>Fit screens on vulnerable colonies and keep equipment covered. See <a href="/wiki/robbing-prevention-and-hive-security.html">Robbing Prevention</a>.</p>

  <h2>Plan for the next gap</h2>
  <p>Plant drought-tolerant forage and staggered bloom near the apiary. See <a href="/wiki/planting-guides-and-seed-mixes.html">Planting Guides</a> and <a href="/wiki/ivy-as-autumn-forage.html">Ivy as Autumn Forage</a>.</p>
