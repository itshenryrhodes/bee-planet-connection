  <h1>Pollination Contracts: The Essentials</h1>
  <p>Clear contracts protect both grower and beekeeper. They set expectations on hive numbers, timing, site access, and paymentâ€”reducing friction during a critical window.</p>

  <h2>What a good contract covers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scope:</strong> crop, blocks, and dates for placement and removal.</li>
    <li><strong>Hive strength:</strong> frames of bees/brood at delivery and verification method.</li>
    <li><strong>Placement & access:</strong> vehicle access, stand locations, water provision.</li>
    <li><strong>Risk & liability:</strong> pesticide use, spray windows, notifications. See <a href="/wiki/pesticide-safety-in-pollination.html">Pesticide Safety in Pollination</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment terms:</strong> rate, deposit, inspection, non-performance clauses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Before you sign</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Walk the site; check forage edges, wind exposure, and water.</li>
    <li>Align hive numbers with bloom density and field layout.</li>
    <li>Agree comms protocol for weather delays and spray alerts.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Proof points</h2>
  <p>Photographs at delivery and a simple inspection sheet keep everyone honest without introducing friction. See <a href="/wiki/inspections-and-records.html">Inspections and Records</a> and <a href="/wiki/pollination-invoices-and-records.html">Invoices &amp; Records</a>.</p>

  <h2>Insurance & compliance</h2>
  <p>Confirm public liability, vehicle cover, and food-handling compliance if on-site extraction is planned. See <a href="/wiki/pollination-service-insurance.html">Pollination Service Insurance</a>.</p>
