**TL;DR** — The wiki is for structured, evergreen guidance. The blog is for timely updates, experiments, and behind-the-scenes notes.

### Why a blog?
- The wiki has a stable house style and taxonomy.
- The blog lets us move quickly – new findings, hornet alerts, or field tips.
- We can decide later which posts “graduate” into full wiki articles.

### What to expect
- Brief posts – a couple of minutes to read.
- Plain language – bright, breezy, practical.
- Cross-linking into relevant wiki pages.
