      <h2>Our commitment</h2>
      <p>We are working to ensure this website is accessible to everyone by following the

      <h2>Measures we’ve taken</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Semantic HTML with clear landmarks (<code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>).</li>
        <li>Accessible, keyboard-operable navigation (including a “skip to content” link).</li>
        <li>Responsive layouts and readable typography.</li>
        <li>High-contrast colour palette with a dark-mode option.</li>
        <li>Descriptive link text and button labels where possible.</li>
        <li>Images intended as content support <code>alt</code> attributes.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Third-party embeds or links may not fully meet our standards.</li>
