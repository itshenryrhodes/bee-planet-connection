# Hero Archive

- Purpose: keep legacy hero-0X-* sources for future creative reuse.
- Live site only serves section-based heroes from site/static/img/hero/.
- Build outputs (site/public/**) are ignored by Git.
- Archive is tracked in Git so originals are always recoverable.
- Consider Git LFS or GitHub Releases if archive grows large.
