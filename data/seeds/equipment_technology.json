  "Overview": "Beekeeping equipment has evolved from skeps and straw baskets to modern Langstroth, National, and Flow Hives. Each design reflects the need for efficiency, hygiene, and colony health.",
  "Types & Variants": "Langstroth and National hives are stackable, modular systems. Top-bar and Warr√© hives prioritise natural comb and low-intervention. Modern Flow Hives introduce tap-style honey harvesting.",
  "Using It Well": "Equipment works best when maintained. Hive boxes should be weatherproofed, frames kept square, and smokers used with care. Cleanliness reduces disease transmission.",
  "Costs & Practicalities": "Wooden hives offer natural insulation but are heavy. Poly hives are light and retain heat but can be fragile. Choosing equipment depends on budget, climate, and management style.",
  "Recent Innovations": "IoT hive sensors monitor weight, temperature, and sound. Automated vaporisers and AI-powered hive monitors are increasingly adopted in commercial setups."
