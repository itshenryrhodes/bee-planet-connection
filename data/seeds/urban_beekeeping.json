{
  "Overview": "Cities often provide diverse forage and surprisingly high honey yields. Studies show urban hives sometimes outperform rural counterparts.",
  "Set-up & Good Neighbour Policy": "Flight barriers, water sources, and hive placement are critical to avoid nuisance. Local councils may require setbacks or permissions.",
  "Management in Urban Context": "Varroa control, swarm prevention, and responsible inspections are essential in dense areas where hives cannot be moved easily.",
  "Debates & Evidence": "Some ecologists question whether urban honeybees compete with wild pollinators. Most evidence suggests coexistence is possible when forage is sufficient."
