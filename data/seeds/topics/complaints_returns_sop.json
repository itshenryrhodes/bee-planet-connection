  "At-a-Glance": "Have a tiny policy and stick to it. Say thank you, ask for the lot code and a photo, then choose a resolution within 24–48 hours: replace, refund, or explain with care (e.g., natural granulation). Log the case, check the retention jar, and note root cause if any. Close the loop with a friendly note and, if appropriate, a small extra. Share patterns at month end and fix the upstream issue (cap torque, label glue, packing). Calm, prompt handling turns a wobble into trust and repeat custom.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Complaints feel personal when you are small, but they are also free audits. A short, written SOP keeps emotion out and speed in: you don’t debate policy mid-email, you follow it. Photos and lot codes save time and help you decide whether it’s a one-off or a batch quirk. Clear, kind language keeps your tone consistent across markets, email and shops. Logging outcomes creates a dataset you can act on—if three returns cite loose lids from the same day, you check torque or swap caps. This habit protects your brand and your weekends; it also teaches you what your jars go through in the wild.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Acknowledge kindly; request lot code, photo, and where bought.",
    "Decide resolution quickly; replace or refund without friction.",
    "Log details; check retention jar and batch sheet.",
    "Identify root cause and add an action to fix upstream.",
    "Close with a friendly note and optional small extra; review monthly."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "An email lands: ‘My jar leaked in the post’. You reply the same day: thanks, sorry, could they share a photo and the tiny code on the back label? The picture shows honey on the lid and a dented corner on the box; the lot code matches a Friday run. You check the retention jar—clean and tight—and the batch sheet notes a mid-run lid change. You send a replacement with a warm card and tighten your packing inserts by one notch for mail orders. \n\nAt month end you skim the log: two returns for crystallisation ‘faults’—you add a clearer care line online and a tiny card in winter orders. One complaint about label residue—you switch to a glue that releases in warm water. The SOP turns random stings into actionable tweaks. Next season, the log is short and boring, which is exactly what you want. Customers remember how fast and kind you were, not just the honey.",
  
  "Evidence Highlights": [
    "Fast, clear resolutions increase satisfaction and repeat purchase.",
    "Lot codes and retention jars support targeted fixes.",

    {"q": "Refunds or replacements?", "a": "Default to the path that’s fastest for the customer and fairest to you."},
    {"q": "What if it’s a taste complaint?", "a": "Offer a swap—taste is subjective and goodwill is cheap compared to churn."}
