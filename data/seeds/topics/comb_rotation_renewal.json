  "At-a-Glance": "Systematic renewal of old brood comb reduces pathogen/pesticide residues and improves brood health.",
  "Why it Matters": "Dark, heavily used comb harbours spores and residues; rotating frames maintains cleaner brood nests and clearer pheromone signalling.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Mark frames by year; each season, move darkest brood frames to edges and replace with foundation near the nest centre; melt/sterilise retired comb; target 1/3 renewal per year so all brood comb is <3 years old.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Do renewals during strong nectar flows to speed drawing; avoid heavy rewiring or large swaps in cold weather.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Letting ‘just one more season’ accumulate; moving brood too far from the cluster; missing labels and losing track.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Frame labelling system, spare foundation, rendering/sterilisation setup, and simple rotation logs."
