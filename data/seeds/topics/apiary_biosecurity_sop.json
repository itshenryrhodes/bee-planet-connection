  "At-a-Glance": "Simple, repeatable hygiene reduces disease spread: clean tools, segregate yards, and deliberate traffic flows.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Cuts risk of AFB/EFB spread and nuisance diseases.",
    "Builds inspector and landowner confidence."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Define clean → dirty workflow and decon steps.",
    "Segregate tools by yard/role; record suspect visits.",
    "Train volunteers on don’t-touch rules."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Colour-coded boxes per yard; bleach/soda ash decon on return.",
    "Disposable gloves changed between colonies; wipes in truck.",
    "Suspect-yard log with 72 h quarantine of kit."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Pack ‘clean’ kit separately; plan order of hives (healthiest first).",
    "2) Use gloves and smoker hygiene; swap hive tools if suspect signs.",
    "3) Bag suspect comb; decon kit; note in yard log.",
    "4) End-of-day: wash suits; soak tools; restock consumables."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Wet days increase mud/contamination—protect vehicle and boxes.",
    "Heat accelerates odours—wash suits more often."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Change gloves between colonies (always); swap tools after suspect contact.",
    "Kit quarantine window after suspect disease visits."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Cross-contamination incident -> Report in log; deep-clean; monitor next visits.",
    "Chronic mouldy kit -> Improve drying/ventilation; add racks.",
    "Volunteer non-compliance -> Retrain; simplify steps; assign roles."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Sharing uncapped drinks/food around open hives.",
    "Mixing suspect comb with wax for rendering.",
    "No handwash kit in vehicle."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Colour bins, sealable bags, disinfectant, brushes, nitrile gloves.",
    "Mobile handwash (water, soap, paper, bin)."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Chemical safety for disinfectants.",
    "Disease notification when thresholds met."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Clean/dirty boxes packed.",
    "Spare gloves and wipes stocked.",
    "Suspect log ready; camera charged."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain ‘clean to dirty’ path before opening first hive."
