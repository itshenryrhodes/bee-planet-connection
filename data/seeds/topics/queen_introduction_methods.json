  "At-a-Glance": "Successful queen introduction hinges on verifying queenlessness, stabilising temperament, and using a paced release method matched to colony conditions.",
  "Why it Matters": "Failed introductions waste money and time, and can trigger laying workers or swarming behaviour.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Confirm no eggs/open brood for ≥3 days or use a test frame. Place caged queen between brood frames with attendants and candy plug. After 3–5 days, assess acceptance; if hostile, extend caging or use a push-in cage over emerging brood. Recheck for eggs/laying pattern after release.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Acceptance improves in nectar flows and with calm weather. Dearth, cold snaps, and aggressive strains need slower introductions.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Introducing into queen-right or unstable colonies, releasing too soon, or neglecting to break down emergency cells.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Introduction cages (candy), push-in cage, queen markers, test frames, smoker/veil.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Breeder/extension protocols on acceptance rates, cage types, and timing nuances."
