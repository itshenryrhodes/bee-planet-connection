  "At-a-Glance": "Short-term queen banking and careful transport protect valuable genetics between rearing, mating, and introduction. Stable temperature, attendants, and ventilation are non-negotiable.",
  "Why it Matters": "Rough handling or overheating kills queens or reduces acceptance. A repeatable protocol saves money and time during intense requeening periods.",
  "Step-by-Step": "For transport: ventilated cages with attendants and candy; keep 15–25°C, shaded, and secure from crushing; avoid car dashboards and direct sun. For banking: use a strong queen-right finisher or a dedicated bank with consistent feed, space, and humidity; inspect daily; limit duration to the minimum practical window.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Heat spikes are the main risk in summer; cold snaps in shoulder seasons. Plan routing and interim stops to avoid temperature extremes.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Dry candy, depleted attendants, caging too long, or mixing unfamiliar odours. Label cages clearly and track arrival dates.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Marked cages, attendants, breathable carriers, temperature loggers (optional), syrup source nearby, and a simple banking frame/box."
