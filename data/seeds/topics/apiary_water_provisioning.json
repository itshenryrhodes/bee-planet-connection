  "At-a-Glance": "Providing attractive, reliable water reduces nuisance at neighbours’ pools and supports brood food production and evaporative cooling.",
  "Why it Matters": "Bees will choose the closest, most reliable source—designing one on-site prevents complaints and heat-stress losses.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Place shallow containers with landing surfaces (pebbles, cork) in sun for warmth; add a consistent trickle or wicking system to keep fresh. Start early in spring so colonies imprint on your source. In heat waves, increase capacity and surface area.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Demand spikes in hot, dry periods and during heavy brood rearing. Prevent freezing in winter if colonies fly on mild days.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Deep, slick-sided buckets that drown bees; allowing stagnation; placing water too far from hives; moving sources mid-season.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Shallow trays, stones/cork, slow drip/float valves or wicks, shade structures, and easy refill access."
