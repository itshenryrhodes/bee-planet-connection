  "At-a-Glance": "Keep it small and lawful. Collect only what you need, get clear consent for newsletters, and store data in as few places as possible. Publish a tiny privacy notice that says what you collect, why, and how to contact you. Set a retention rule (e.g., delete stale signups after 24 months). Honour unsubscribe clicks and handle access requests politely and on time. If you lose a device or list, act fast and follow guidance. Calm, clean habits protect trust and keep you on the right side of the law.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Names and emails are easy to scatter across phones, spreadsheets and socials. That increases breach risk and makes basic rights hard to honour. A GDPR-lite approach suits micro producers and clubs: pick one system for mailing lists with double opt-in, keep sales records separate and minimal, and never add people without consent. A short privacy notice on your site and a contact for data questions show maturity. Retention rules reduce junk and risk. If someone asks to see or delete their data, you can respond quickly because your system is simple. Breaches are rare but stressful; a one page plan with who to tell and when turns panic into steps. Data care is customer care.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Map your data: where emails and orders live; reduce copies.",
    "Adopt double opt-in for newsletters; separate sales data from marketing.",
    "Publish a short privacy notice and a contact email.",
    "Set retention rules and a monthly tidy reminder.",
    "Write a one page breach and subject access response plan."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Your list lives in one tool with double opt-in. Signups from the stall go via a QR to that tool, not a paper sheet that goes missing. Order emails sit in your shop platform or simple spreadsheet with only what is needed for delivery and records. A small privacy page explains that you collect emails for updates, that unsubscribing is one click, and that you do not share data beyond essential services for payments and delivery. Once a month you archive bounced addresses and delete stale test contacts. If someone emails ‘what data do you hold about me?’, you can answer in a day because there are only two places to check. When a phone is lost, you have a password manager and can revoke access. You note the incident, follow official guidance on whether to notify, and write down what you changed. The system feels like your stall: tidy, simple, and respectful of people’s time and trust.",
  
  "Evidence Highlights": [
    "Data minimisation and single-source lists reduce breach risk.",
    "Double opt-in and clear privacy notices improve trust and compliance.",
    "Simple retention rules reduce clutter and speed access responses."
