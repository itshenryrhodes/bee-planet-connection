  "At-a-Glance": "Keep socials light and useful. Post on a steady cadence (weekly works), share clean photos, and write short captions that teach or update: forage notes, market dates, care tips for set honey, a tidy shot of your stall. Pin an FAQ with pricing, returns, and how to contact you. Moderate kindly, ignore bait, and move long answers to DMs or email. Use alt text on images, get consent for people in photos, and save your best posts for reuse. Socials should feel like your stall: friendly, bright and breezy, never frantic.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Socials can drain time or quietly support sales depending on how you frame them. A small, predictable plan protects your focus: one post a week, one story on market day, and an occasional seasonal reel. Helpful content brings followers back—a short crystallisation tip beats a dozen hashtags. Consistent voice and neat visuals carry your brand across posts, newsletters and stalls. Pinning common answers reduces repetitive replies; alt text and clear type widen access. Consent and moderation safeguard reputation, especially for clubs with volunteers and children in photos. Treat social platforms as rented shop windows: tidy, welcoming, and updated just enough to stay fresh without stealing time from beekeeping.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Pick 1–2 platforms; set a weekly slot to post.",
    "Create a simple content calendar (forage, market dates, tips).",
    "Shoot clean, consistent photos; write short, plain captions.",
    "Add alt text, get photo consent, pin FAQ and contact.",
    "Moderate kindly; move complex chats to DM or email; archive best posts."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Your Friday routine includes a quick photo of the apiary or a clean jar shot by a window. Caption: three plain lines—what’s flowering, where you’ll be, and a tiny tip. A pinned post answers ‘Do you deliver?’ and ‘What to do if honey sets?’. On market mornings you post a single story of the tidy stall; later you reshare a customer photo with thanks (permission first). When comments veer into debates about bee counts, you thank, link to official guidance, and step away. Once a quarter you save your strongest photos and captions into a folder so your website and sell sheets borrow the same calm tone. Socials stay in their place—useful, kind and quick.",
