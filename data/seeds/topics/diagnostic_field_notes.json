  "At-a-Glance": "Good notes turn ‘I think’ into ‘I know’. Use a simple, repeatable scheme: Hive–Box–Frame–Side–Position (e.g., H3-B1-F4-A-pos2), date/time, weather, and what you saw (cue words not essays). Photograph frames with a label in-shot so images stand alone. For samples, write the same code on pots/slides. Keep a one-page ‘minimum dataset’—items you always collect—so every inspection produces comparable, useful records. When you later call an inspector or compare hives, you’ll have a clean, shared language.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Beekeeping memories are optimistic; data is not. When disease scares happen (EFB/AFB suspects, odd brood, pesticide incidents), messy notes waste time and create risk. A minimal, standard set—ID, location on the frame, photo with scale/label, brood state, weather, action taken—lets others help fast and lets you review your own decisions calmly. It also unlocks teaching: clubs can show beginners exactly what ‘good recordkeeping’ looks like and why. Over a season, those tiny habits compound: faster diagnosis, fewer repeated mistakes, cleaner handovers, and articles you can write with confidence because the details are already there.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Adopt a fixed code: Hive–Box–Frame–Side–Position.",
    "Carry weatherproof labels; put them in-frame for photos.",
    "Write the minimum dataset every visit; avoid prose.",
    "Name photos with the code + date; sync to a shared folder.",
    "Review monthly; convert notes into actions for the next visit."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Picture two inspections. In one, you scribble ‘weird brood H3’ and hurry on. In the other, you write ‘H3-B1-F4-A-pos2, brood pre-capping uneven, smell neutral, temp 18 °C, light wind; action: photo + recheck in 7 days’. The first note will haunt you; the second will help you. Field notes are about reducing ambiguity for future-you (and anyone helping), so design them like a checklist. Keep pencil/marker and small waterproof tags in your pocket; label before you shoot the photo so the image makes sense months later. For sampling, use the same code on the pot and in the log, then snap a photo of the jar with the frame in the background—it prevents mix-ups. \n\nThe biggest win is in trend spotting. By logging the same minimum dataset each time—weight/heft, brood state, temperament, mite %—you’ll see drift before it becomes drama. When you do need official help, those labelled photos mean an inspector or mentor can triage from their desk. This isn’t bureaucracy; it’s kindness to your future self, wrapped in a habit that takes 60 seconds and pays you back for years.",
  
  "Evidence Highlights": [
    "Consistent identifiers make photos and samples actionable without you present.",
    "Minimum datasets increase comparability and reduce recall bias.",
    "Clear labelling accelerates third-party triage/inspection."
