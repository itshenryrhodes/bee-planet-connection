{
  "Overview": "Chalkbrood (Ascosphaera apis) mummifies larvae into hard, white or grey pellets. It flares in cool, damp springs or in nutritionally or genetically stressed colonies.",
  "Biology & Transmission": "Larvae ingest spores; chilled brood and high humidity favour germination. Spores persist on combs and debris and spread via frames and tools.",
  "Symptoms & Field Diagnosis": "Spotty brood with chalk-like mummies on floors, alighting boards, or in cells. Mummies are lightweight and rattling; distinguish from AFB/EFB by texture and absence of ropiness.",
  "Impact on Colony": "Reduced brood replacement slows spring expansion and can erode honey yields.",
  "Control & Treatment": "Improve ventilation, reduce moisture, replace old brood comb, boost nutrition, and consider requeening from tolerant stock.",
  "Prevention & Good Practice": "Keep strong, well-fed colonies, avoid chilling brood during inspections, and maintain hygiene to reduce spore loads."
