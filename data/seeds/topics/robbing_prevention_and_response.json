  "At-a-Glance": "Robbing is a high-stress event that spreads disease and can trigger yard-wide chaos. Prevention through tidy feeding and entrance management is best.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Robbing spreads spores and viruses via frantic bee contact.",
    "Colonies can be stripped of stores quickly, leading to collapse.",
    "Neighbours notice aggressive clouds; reputational risk rises."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Feed internally and cleanly; never open-feed during dearth.",
    "Control entrance sizes on weak colonies.",
    "React fast with covers and screens at the first signs."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Minimal external spills; no exposed cappings or honey.",
    "Entrance reducers and robbing screens ready for quick deployment.",
    "Yard layout that avoids concentrated flight lines over weak colonies."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Prevention: feed inside the hive; wipe drips; keep yards tidy.",
    "2) Early signals: frenetic zig-zag flights at entrances, fights on the landing board, wax flakes on ground.",
    "3) Immediate response: close down entrances to single-bee width; add robbing screens; wet sheet over hive for 24 h if severe.",
    "4) Remove attractants: seal exposed honey, take off spilled frames; stop external feeding.",
    "5) Stabilise: after 24–48 h, slowly reopen; reassess colony strength and nutrition."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Most common in late summer dearths or during drought.",
    "Windless hot days amplify odour plumes from spills."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Any fighting at the entrance with wax debris = act now.",
    "Weak nucs and recent splits are highest risk; pre-empt with reducers."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Bees swirling with sudden spikes in traffic -> Fit screens/reducers -> Remove attractants.",
    "Symptom: Only one colony targeted -> Check queen status and stores; consider combining or feeding discreetly.",
    "Symptom: Multiple colonies involved -> Yard-wide tidy-up; suspend manipulations until flow returns."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Open feeding sugar/honey during dearth.",
    "Leaving wet cappings or extracted supers outside.",
    "Too-wide entrances on small populations."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Entrance reducers, robbing screens, wet sheets, internal feeders.",
    "Bee-safe water sources to reduce risky foraging patterns."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Expect elevated defensiveness; use full PPE.",
    "Communicate with neighbours if visible clouds form; reassure with steps taken."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Reducers/screens to hand.",
    "No sticky kit exposed.",
    "Weak colonies flagged and protected.",
    "Follow-up check scheduled."

  "Communications": [
