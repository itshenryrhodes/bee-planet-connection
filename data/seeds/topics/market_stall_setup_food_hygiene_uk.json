  "At-a-Glance": "A tidy stall sells. Register as a food business with your local authority, carry public liability insurance, and keep labels compliant. On the day, run a clean table with a washable cloth, covered products, a handwashing setup or sanitiser, and a simple allergen statement. Use clear price boards and batch coded jars. Keep float, receipts, and a short spiel about origin. Sampling is optional - if you do it, use clean spoons and a waste pot. A quick pack list and a 10 minute setup routine make early mornings calm and consistent.",

  "Why it Matters": "Markets are quick trust tests. Shoppers glance, judge hygiene, read a label, and decide in 5 seconds. Compliance underpins confidence: registration shows you are on the map, insurance protects you and the market, and clean practice protects your brand. A clear stall avoids crowd friction and speeds choices: readable prices, visible weights, and simple origin claims. Sampling is where things slip - unmanaged, it creates mess and risk. A written micro SOP keeps it safe and swift. Finally, markets are noisy: a one sentence story about forage and place will do more than a banner of buzzwords. When the stall is disciplined, you sell more with fewer questions and leave the site with fewer sticky surprises and no compliance headaches.",

  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Register as a food business and confirm market requirements.",
    "Prepare compliant labels and batch log for the jars you bring.",
    "Pack kit: cloth, covers, price boards, sanitizer, bin, float, receipts.",
    "Set up early: clean table, stock staged, prices visible, bags ready.",
    "Operate cleanly: handle jars by necks, manage samples, wipe often, log sales."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "The best stalls look boring in the best way. You arrive early, lay a washable cloth, and stage stock by size so hands move left to right. A small hand gel and a roll of paper towels sit under the table next to a waste bin. Price boards are legible from 2 meters - no chalk scrawl that needs decoding. Jars face forward with labels aligned and batch coded so any customer query routes back to a date and apiary. If you sample, you place a small tray, single use spoons, a waste pot, and you narrate: a pea sized taste on a spoon, bin it, no double dips. The stall tells a clean story - simple origin line, your name and contact, and a smile. Receipts and float live in a hard case, not a pocket. When the rush ends you note jar counts and reorder points. At pack down, lids go on boxes, the area is swept, and a quick photo of the stall helps the next setup. Next time is easier because the list and layout live in your bag. Markets reward rhythm - do the same tidy dance each week and customers will spot you and return because buying from you is easy.",
