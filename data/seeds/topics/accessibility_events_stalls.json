  "At-a-Glance": "Inclusion is a series of small choices. Keep aisles clear and step-free, use large type on price boards, and offer a chair for those who need it. Provide a quiet explanation card for those who prefer reading to chat. Mark allergens clearly on any samples and keep hand gel visible. If hosting a talk or open day, publish access info in advance: step-free routes, toilets, seating, and contact for adjustments. Train helpers to offer help rather than assume. These simple norms widen your welcome and reduce stress for visitors and volunteers alike.",

  "Why it Matters": "Community work should be for everyone, but markets and talks often exclude by accident: tiny print, cluttered layouts, or noisy demos with no alternative. A few low-cost tweaks change outcomes. Clear paths make stalls approachable for wheelchair users and parents with buggies; large type helps many people, not just those with low vision; a written explainer respects those who find busy chat hard; and pre-published access notes reduce awkward on-the-day surprises. Volunteers benefit too—clear layouts and roles reduce overload and make helping feel safe. Inclusion is not a bolt-on; it is a calm way of working that fits the bright and breezy tone we aim for in all comms.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Publish simple access info for events; invite adjustment requests.",
    "Design stalls with clear fronts, no clutter, and large type prices.",
    "Prepare a one page ‘about the honey’ card and a visual sampling SOP.",
    "Brief volunteers to offer help and to keep aisles clear.",
    "Review after events; note barriers and quick fixes for next time."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "You lay your stall like a small room: tables back by 10–15 cm so wheels can pass, banner clipped high, and a single price board with large numerals. A folding chair sits behind the table for those who need rest. Sampling happens on a tray with clear signage and a small visual showing one spoon per taste. You keep a printed card that explains who you are, what granulation is, and how to contact you later—anyone can read quietly then nod. For an open day you post a short access note on the invite: parking, step-free route, loos, seating, sensory triggers (smoker smell, buzzing videos), and a person to email for adjustments. Volunteers are briefed to offer help—‘Would you like a seat?’—and to keep pathways tidy. After each event you ask for feedback and add small fixes: a mat over a cable, a higher contrast sign, a quieter demo corner. Over time, your stall feels calm and welcoming, and more people linger and buy because they feel seen.",

    "Large, high-contrast signage improves comprehension and dwell time.",
    "Published access info reduces last minute queries and drop-offs.",
