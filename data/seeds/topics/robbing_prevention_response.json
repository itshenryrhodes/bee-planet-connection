  "At-a-Glance": "Robbing escalates quickly in dearthâ€”reduce entrances, stop spills, and stabilise weak colonies immediately.",
  "Why it Matters": "Unchecked robbing spreads disease, exhausts stores, and can collapse multiple hives in a yard.",
  "Step-by-Step": "At first signs (frenzied flight, fighting at entrances): 1) Close down entrances to a single small gap; add robbing screens. 2) Cease open feeding; tidy spills; remove wet supers. 3) Move or combine very weak colonies; feed internally at dusk. 4) Resume normal entrances only when flight calms for several days.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Common mid/late summer and during droughts; windless hot afternoons are high risk.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Feeding externally, wide entrances on weak nucs, and prolonged inspections with honey exposed.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Entrance reducers, robbing screens, internal feeders, spray bottle of water to break fights, and spare nucs for combines."
