  "At-a-Glance": "During dearths, colonies can starve or become defensive and prone to robbing. Proactive feed, space management, and entrance control preserve colony health.",
  "Why it Matters": "Stress during dearth compounds disease and queen issues, setting colonies back for the next flow or winter.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Confirm true dearth (weight loss, forager behaviour). Reduce entrances, avoid open feeding, and move to internal feeders. Provide thin syrup for stimulation or thicker syrup for stores depending on goals. Keep inspections short; avoid dripping honey. Remove excess empty supers that chill or invite pests.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Common in mid- to late-summer post-main flow; drought amplifies risk. Urban microclimates may soften dearth with ornamental plantings.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Open feeding that sparks robbing, leaving large entrances, and stimulating brood when you cannot support it with nutrition."
