{
  "Overview": "Choose hives and hardware to match climate, lifting limits, and management style.",
  "Types & Variants": "Langstroth/National: modular, high yield, heavier lifts. Top-bar: simple inspections, natural comb, limited expansion. Warr√©: quilt box moisture control, bottom-addition stacking.",
  "Using It Well": "Keep frames square; rotate old comb; maintain boxes and roofs; use open-mesh floors for ventilation/Varroa drop where appropriate.",
  "Costs & Practicalities": "Wood vs poly trade-offs (durability vs insulation/weight). Consider frame counts and box sizes to manage lift weight.",
  "Recent Innovations": "Flow frames for direct draw-off; IoT scales and acoustic/temp monitoring; safer OA delivery devices."
