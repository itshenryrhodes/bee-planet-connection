{
  "At-a-Glance": "Varroa prefer drone brood. Cycling in and out drone frames to trap and remove mites is a proven biotechnical control with no chemical residues.",
  "Why it Matters": "Regular removal suppresses mite growth between chemical treatments and reduces reliance on actives.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Insert drone foundation frames at brood margins. Allow capping, then remove and freeze before emergence. Scrape and return frames. Repeat aligned to drone cycles. Track mite counts to verify benefit.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Most useful during spring and summer when drones are abundant.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Missing emergence windows, placing frames too centrally, and failing to confirm impact with counts.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Drone frames, freezer, calendar reminders, mite monitoring kit.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Consult IPM guides for timing and efficacy benchmarks."
