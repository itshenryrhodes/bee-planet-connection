  "At-a-Glance": "Right-sized space at the right time prevents backfilling, reduces swarming pressure, and converts nectar flows into marketable honey with clean cappings.",
  "Why it Matters": "Late or excessive supering costs yield: too little space triggers congestion; too much cold headroom slows wax drawing and ripening.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Before the first flow, add one super of mostly drawn comb if available. During the flow, add a new super when the top super is about 70% drawn or capped. Keep frames tight and square; alternate drawn with foundation to guide drawing. Once capped, pull and replace quickly to keep headroom.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "In cool springs, favour drawn comb to avoid chilling; in hot, heavy flows, stage multiple supers in advance. Adjust to crop rhythms (e.g., OSR sets fast; lime may be intermittent).",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Adding two empty supers at once in cold weather, leaving brace comb to propagate misalignment, and ignoring backfilled brood nests that throttle lay.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Spare supers, drawn comb, spacers, queen excluders in good repair, hive scales or hefting routine, and a simple percent-capped log."
