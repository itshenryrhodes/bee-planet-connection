{
  "Overview": "Top-bar hives prioritise simplicity and natural comb, trading off honey yield and standardisation. They suit low-lift beekeeping and observational goals while demanding attentive comb management.",
  "Types & Variants": "Common patterns include Kenyan (sloped sides) and Tanzanian (straight sides). Bars use guides or beveled edges to encourage straight comb; windows aid inspection without dismantling.",
  "Using It Well": "Keep hives level and bars square; insert new bars between straight, drawn comb to prevent cross-comb. Manage space incrementally to avoid collapses in hot weather. Harvest by cutting comb and straining, leaving enough stores for the colony.",
  "Costs & Practicalities": "Materials are inexpensive and lifts are light, but extraction is labour-intensive and standard frames/supers are incompatible with stacked hive systems.",
  "Recent Innovations": "Hybrid systems pair TBH brood nests with superable boxes for honey; modular bars and better observation windows reduce disturbance during inspections.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Consult dedicated TBH management guides for spacing, bar design, and seasonal workflows."
