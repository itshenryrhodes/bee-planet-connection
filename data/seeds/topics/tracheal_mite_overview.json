  "At-a-Glance": "Tracheal mites (Acarapis woodi) infest adult bee airways, historically causing winter losses. Prevalence is lower in many regions but identification and management remain relevant.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Can contribute to winter morbidity where present.",
    "Differential diagnosis prevents misattributing losses."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Understand signs and confirm presence via lab/microscopy when suspected.",
    "Support colonies through nutrition and ventilation; consider resistant stock.",
    "Integrate with broader IPM rather than chasing rare causes."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Loss investigations consider tracheal mites alongside varroa, nutrition, and moisture.",
    "Stock bred for mite resistance where regional risk exists.",
    "Clear records of sampling and outcomes."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Suspect if: crawling bees in cold with disorientation, historical regional presence.",
    "2) Confirm: submit samples or use trained microscopy; avoid assumptions.",
    "3) Mitigate: improve winter ventilation and nutrition; consider resistant lines; follow any approved treatments regionally.",
    "4) Review: align with varroa control and moisture management."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Winter clusters show signs more clearly.",
    "Cold, damp sites exacerbate stressors."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Rely on lab/official guidance for prevalence; track alongside other loss drivers.",
    "Use trend data, not single anecdotes, to justify interventions."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Crawlers mid-winter with adequate stores -> Check moisture/ventilation -> Consider tracheal mite sampling.",
    "Symptom: Yard-wide losses -> Prioritise varroa/DWV, then niche causes.",
    "Symptom: Long-term problem at site -> Reassess siting and genetics."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Over-attributing losses to tracheal mites without evidence.",
    "Neglecting major drivers (varroa, moisture) while chasing rare ones."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Sampling kits, microscopy or lab submission.",
    "Ventilation tuning; stock selection."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Follow local approvals for any treatments.",
    "Record findings for seasonal reviews."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Samples taken if suspected.",
    "Ventilation and moisture reviewed.",
    "Genetics and site notes updated."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Set expectations: confirm first, then act."
