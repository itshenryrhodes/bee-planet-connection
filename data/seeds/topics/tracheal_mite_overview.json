{
  "Overview": "Tracheal mites infest the breathing tubes of adult bees, impairing gas exchange and shortening lifespans. Once a major issue in some regions, prevalence has declined with stock selection and modern management.",
  "Biology & Transmission": "Mites spread through close contact, especially in winter clusters. Infestations peak in older workers; cold stress and genetics modulate impact.",
  "Symptoms & Field Diagnosis": "Non-specific signs—disoriented crawling bees, reduced flight, and winter losses—overlap with other problems. Definitive diagnosis requires dissection or lab testing; consider history and exclusion of other causes.",
  "Impact on Colony": "Elevated winter mortality, poor spring build-up, and supered susceptibility to other stressors. Impact is often synergistic rather than singular.",
  "Control & Treatment": "Stock with known tolerance, maintain strong colonies, and manage moisture/ventilation. Follow any local veterinary guidance; some historical treatments are no longer approved—check current labels.",
  "Prevention & Good Practice": "Avoid importing untested stock; prioritise hygienic traits; reduce stressors that force prolonged tight clustering."
