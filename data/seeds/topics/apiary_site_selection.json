  "At-a-Glance": "Good sites balance forage access, sun, wind protection, drainage, and neighbour relations.",
  "Why it Matters": "Location influences colony health, winter survival, and apiary safety.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Assess wind/sun exposure; ensure year-round water; provide firm, level stands; orient entrances away from paths; plan vehicle access and biosecurity.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "High ground drains well in wet winters; shade helps in heat waves; hedge lines act as flight barriers near boundaries.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Flood-prone low spots, cramped access for supers, and entrances facing public footpaths.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Stands, straps, water supply, fencing/hedging, and signage where appropriate."
