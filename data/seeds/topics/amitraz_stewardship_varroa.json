  "At-a-Glance": "Amitraz can be effective, but resistance risk is real. Stewardship means rotation, correct dose, and full-course adherence.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Delays resistance and preserves options.",
    "Improves predictability of outcomes."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Follow label dose and duration exactly.",
    "Rotate active ingredients across seasons.",
    "Verify reduction and record lots."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Full course completed; strips/tabs spaced correctly.",
    "Rotation plan avoids repeated use back-to-back.",
    "Post-course sampling shows expected drop."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Count frames of brood/bees to place correct number of strips.",
    "2) Space in brood area; avoid clumping; start timer.",
    "3) Remove on time; dispose safely; verify counts.",
    "4) Record product, lot, dates, and outcomes."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Use outside honey super periods for market honey.",
    "Heat extremes may affect behaviourâ€”monitor."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Label exposure days and strip density per brood area.",
    "Reduction targets and re-check windows."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Low effect -> Placement wrong or resistance rising; switch class.",
    "Brood impacts -> Check spacing and duration; review colony health."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Leaving strips in too long.",
    "Reusing product back-to-back seasons.",
    "Not spacing strips through the brood nest."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Timers, placement templates, sampling kits.",
    "Rotation calendar by yard."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Follow label; remove before supering for sale honey.",
    "Safe disposal and handling."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Strips placed and logged.",
    "Removal date set.",
    "Verification sampling booked."
