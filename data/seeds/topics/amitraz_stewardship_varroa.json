  "At-a-Glance": "Amitraz-based products remain effective varroacides in many regions, but resistance pressure grows with overuse. Stewardship means label-compliant dosing, full-course treatments, rotation, and verification with counts.",
  "Why it Matters": "Losing a mode of action narrows the toolbox and increases winter losses. Responsible use preserves efficacy and protects bees and markets.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Confirm thresholds; remove honey supers if required; place strips per brood size; respect duration and temperature limits; remove on schedule; repeat counts post-treatment. Rotate with non-amitraz methods in subsequent cycles (thymol, OA with brood breaks, biotechnical controls). Record batch numbers and dates.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Often used post-harvest in late summer/early autumn. Avoid extremes outside label ranges and adapt colony ventilation to prevent stress.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Under-dosing, leaving strips in too long, or repeating back-to-back seasons. Skipping verification counts hides emerging resistance.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Approved amitraz product, timer/calendar, mite sampling kit, records for audits and future planning."
