  "At-a-Glance": "Track jars and batches from tank to customer. Simple codes and par levels prevent stockouts and chaos.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Enables recalls and wholesale confidence.",
    "Saves time at markets and online packing."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Adopt a single batch code format across all SKUs.",
    "Set par levels per channel and plan replenishment.",
    "Record moves between stores, vans, and stockists."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Master sheet: batch → SKU → quantity → location.",
    "Reorder triggers by week and event calendar.",
    "Pick/pack sheet with FEFO (first-expiry-first-out)."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Define batch code and label position.",
    "2) Record jarring counts to master; split to channels.",
    "3) At pick: scan/mark; at return: reconcile and adjust.",
    "4) Review weekly; book next jarring run."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Pre-Christmas par levels higher; heat affects wax/candles storage.",
    "Heather/varietal limited runs tracked separately."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Par levels by SKU/channel; reorder lead time noted.",
    "Breakage/spoilage rate tracked and minimised."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Issue: Stockouts -> Raise par; shorten lead times; batch more frequently.",
    "Issue: Lost batch trace -> Fix label position and scanning habit.",
    "Issue: Overstock -> Bundle or sample near end of season."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Multiple code styles over years.",
    "Counting in vans but not reconciling.",
    "No separation of wholesale cases vs singles."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Shared spreadsheet or light inventory app; QR/barcodes optional.",
    "Pick tickets for markets and wholesale orders."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Weights/measures verified; batch codes legible.",
    "Secure food storage away from chemicals and pets."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Par levels set; calendar synced.",
    "Batch master updated after jarring.",
    "Pick/pack sheets printed."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Teach volunteers where to find batch codes fast."
