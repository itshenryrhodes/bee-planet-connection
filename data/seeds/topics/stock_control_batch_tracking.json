  "At-a-Glance": "Know what you have and where it came from. Use simple lot codes that encode date and apiary, label every case, and keep a small retention jar per lot. Store boxes cool and dark, front-facing oldest first (FIFO). Run a quick monthly stocktake with a clipboard or simple sheet. Record what leaves for markets, shops, and online orders. Tie returns or questions to lot codes fast. The goal is boringly predictable stock and a two-minute answer to ‘which batch was this jar from?’.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Small producers lose money in the margins—mystery boxes, mixed cases, and guesswork at markets. Light discipline turns chaos into cash: FIFO protects quality; batch codes connect jars to days and supers; and a monthly count stops surprises before the busy season. Clear case labels help when friends help pack or when you load the car in the dark. Retention jars let you check texture and flavour months later and back up claims. If a shop calls about a leaker, you read the lot, check the retention sample, and decide calmly whether to swap a few jars or investigate a whole day’s run. Stock control isn’t warehouse cosplay; it’s kindness to future you.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Create a lot code pattern (e.g., YYMMDD-apiary).",
    "Label jars and cases; store FIFO on cool, dark shelves.",
    "Keep a retention jar and a batch sheet per lot.",
    "Log outs by channel (market/shop/online) and date.",
    "Stocktake monthly; reconcile differences and note actions."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Shelves wear big, clear case labels: ‘230815-A3 runny’ with a batch code and jar count. Boxes live in rows with oldest at the front. On a Friday you pull for the market using FIFO, note case counts on a simple sheet, and throw a pen in the crate. A shop order lands midweek; you pick full cases, add a delivery note that lists lots, and you’re out the door without second-guessing. \n\nA month later, a customer emails about a lid that came loose. You ask for the tiny code on the back label, check the retention jar, and confirm the batch looks and tastes right; you replace the jar and make a note. If you spot a pattern, you look back at the bottling sheet—was that the day the cap torque felt light? Action flows from records: tighten the torque check, add a new tickbox. None of this needs software—paper, tidy shelves, and habits keep jars flowing and stories straight.",
  
  "Evidence Highlights": [
    "FIFO and cool, dark storage extend perceived quality.",
    "Lot coding and retention samples enable targeted fixes.",
    "Regular stocktakes reduce write-offs and panic before events."
