  "What It Is": "Mead is a fermented beverage made from honey, water, and yeast; styles range from dry to sweet, still to sparkling, and can include fruits/spices (melomel, metheglin).",
  "Harvesting & Processing": "Choose clean, characterful honey. Sanitise equipment thoroughly. Rehydrate wine yeast with nutrients; manage temperature to avoid off-flavours; rack off lees to clarify. Stabilise before sweetening or bottling to prevent refermentation.",
  "Properties & Uses": "Honey choice shapes aroma and body. Acid balance and tannin structure define finish; longer ageing refines harsh notes. Sparkling meads require careful priming and bottle conditioning or force carbonating.",
  "Market & Value": "Local provenance and small-batch storytelling resonate with consumers. Comply with alcoholic beverage regulations, labelling, and duty where applicable.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Use reputable enology resources for nutrient regimes, pH targets, and sanitation protocols."
