  "At-a-Glance": "Biosecurity is layout plus habits. Separate ‘dirty’ and ‘clean’ zones, quarantine unknown kit, and choose the right method for the job: scorching timber for general sanitation, approved solutions (sodium hypochlorite/caustic) for tools and boxes, and strict controls for notifiable diseases (follow inspector direction). Cull suspect frames rather than ‘rescuing’ them; label batches and store dry, bee-tight. Keep a tiny field kit: scraper, wipes, gloves, bags, and a marker. Process once, properly, and future you avoids mystery infections and sticky sheds.",

  "Why it Matters": "Disease spreads with us—on gloves, tools and borrowed boxes. A tidy biosecurity routine is cheaper than a spring of sick colonies. The basics are straightforward: never mix unknown kit into brood boxes without cleaning; scorch or disinfect between yards; and keep a quarantine corner for swarms or rescued kit. When you do clean, match method to material: timber loves flame; plastics don’t. Caustic baths strip propolis and wax; hypochlorite sanitises tools; both need PPE and correct disposal. For AFB/EFB suspicion, stop and call the inspector—burn policies and legal controls exist for a reason. Storage is the last mile: dry, ventilated, bee-tight rooms stop wax moth and robbing. Record what you cleaned, how and when. Clubs can host a ‘clean day’ so beginners see pace, PPE and disposal done right. The reward: fewer cross-yard infections, faster spring setup, and equipment you trust.",

  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Set ‘dirty’/‘clean’ zones; bin liners for transport.",
    "Scrape gross debris; choose scorch vs chemical method.",
    "Apply method with PPE; rinse/dry; label date/method.",
    "Quarantine swarms/unknown kit; inspect before reuse.",
    "Store dry and bee-tight; log batch and location."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Picture your shed as a small lab with arrows. Boxes enter the ‘dirty’ door, get scraped, then either meet flame (timber) or a bath (plastic-safe solution). Tools cycle through a dip pot you refresh routinely. Frames get triaged: good wax stays, bad leaves, and anything suspicious is bagged and held for an inspector or destroyed. A whiteboard notes what was cleaned and where it now lives. \n\nThe same thinking travels to yards. A roll of bin liners separates wet supers in a car; disposable gloves and a marker keep cross-contamination down; and a simple rule—new swarms live apart until inspected—prevents surprises. On notifiable disease, you don’t freelance: call, secure the site, and do what the officer directs. That professionalism protects you and the local beekeeping community. Store kit like it’s food equipment: dry, rodent-proof, and labelled. When you reach for a box in spring, knowing it was scorched or disinfected on a date removes doubt—and doubt is what slows good decisions on the first warm day.",
  
  "Evidence Highlights": [
    "Cross-contamination via gloves/tools is a common vector.",
    "Timber scorching and approved disinfectants reduce pathogen load.",
    "Quarantine reduces introduction risk from unknown sources."
