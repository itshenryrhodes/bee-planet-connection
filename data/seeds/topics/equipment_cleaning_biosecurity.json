  "At-a-Glance": "Clean, dry, labelled equipment lasts longer and spreads fewer problems. Write the wash/decon routine on the wall.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Reduces disease transfer and sticky pests.",
    "Extends life of expensive woodware and suits."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Standardise cleaning levels: routine vs suspect-yard deep clean.",
    "Dry and store to prevent mould and mice.",
    "Track kit to yards with basic labelling."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Three bins: wash, disinfect, rinse; drying racks.",
    "Heat/chemical options documented; PPE available.",
    "Labels by yard; log of deep cleans after suspect visits."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Scrape propolis/wax; pre-soak where needed.",
    "2) Clean with detergent; disinfect per product guidance (soda ash/bleach).",
    "3) Rinse; air-dry fully; inspect for damage.",
    "4) Store sealed; log date/yard; repair or retire damaged kit."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Winter drying slower—use heated space or dehumidifier.",
    "Summer mould risk lower but pests higher—seal boxes."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Contact time for disinfectants; batch records.",
    "Retirement criteria for frames/boxes (cracks, disease exposure)."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Persistent odours -> Repeat decon; check storage humidity.",
    "Warped boxes -> Dry too fast/hot; adjust method.",
    "Recurring wax moth in stored kit -> Freeze cycle; improve sealing."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Skipping rinse after disinfectant.",
    "Stacking damp equipment.",
    "Unlabelled boxes moving between yards."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Scrapers, pressure washer (careful), soda ash/bleach tubs.",
    "Drying racks, mouse guards, freezer for frames."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "COSHH for chemicals; eye/hand protection.",
    "Waste effluent disposed per local rules."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Bins filled and labelled.",
    "Drying area ventilated.",
    "Repair bin stocked (nails, glue, staples)."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Train on chemical concentrations with laminated chart."
