  "At-a-Glance": "Swarming is natural but avoidable with timely space management and queen control. Prevention saves honey and neighboursâ€™ goodwill.",
  "Why it Matters": "Unmanaged swarms reduce crop potential and can cause complaints. Preventing swarms keeps colonies productive and safe.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Provide space ahead of flows; equalise brood and stores; remove queen cells or use controlled splits; requeen from young stock. Classic methods include Demaree, Pagden, or nucleus splits to bleed swarm pressure.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Peak swarming coincides with spring build-up and early flows; move early before swarm cells proliferate.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Adding supers too late, skipping inspections during peak, and leaving multiple charged queen cells.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Spare boxes, frames, marked queens, and nuc equipment for splits.",
  "Notes": ""
