  "At-a-Glance": "Small hive beetle (SHB) adults are oval, dark, scuttling beetles; larvae cause the real trouble—sliming comb and fermenting honey. In the UK/EU it’s a notifiable invasive: ID, quarantine, and report—don’t DIY ‘eradicate’. Watch for adults running from light on frame surfaces, clustered in corners, or hiding under top bars; check for larvae trails and honey that looks frothy or smells off. Movement controls apply: don’t shift bees or kit off-site. Accurate photos and a calm, documented response help authorities act fast.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "SHB can turn comb into a foamy mess and ruin honey stores quickly, especially in warm conditions or weak colonies. The species spreads with moved bees and equipment, so one enthusiastic but misinformed beekeeper can seed a regional problem. Awareness isn’t panic—it’s a practiced flow: inspect, document, isolate, and report through official channels. Indiscriminate trapping or chemical improvisation risks non-target impacts and legal trouble. Good yard hygiene, strong colonies and sensible storage habits reduce attractiveness and resilience to infestation. Clubs benefit from drills and ID briefings so a first sighting gets handled by the book, not social media. The result is faster containment and less collateral damage if SHB ever appears in your area.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "During inspections, check frame top bars and corners for adults.",
    "If suspicious: photograph, note location, close hive calmly.",
    "Isolate the apiary—no movement of bees/kit/honey.",
    "Report through national channels; follow instructions precisely.",
    "Review storage hygiene; keep supers bee/SHB-tight."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "SHB stories move faster than facts. Stay grounded: you are looking for a small, dark, scuttling beetle that avoids light and a larval stage that leaves greasy trails and foaming honey. If you think you’ve found it, you don’t need heroics; you need documentation and a phone call. National teams know the playbook and will bring traps, lures and procedures that are approved. Until then, lock down movements. In parallel, run your own prevention basics: strong colonies, tidy apiaries, supers stored bee-tight in clean rooms, and no unattended comb at the apiary edge. These habits pay off against other pests too. Practising the reporting flow once at a club night—photos with scale, location notes, calm comms—means you’ll do it right when it counts.",
  
  "Evidence Highlights": [
    "Adults hide from light; larvae slime comb causing fermentation.",
    "Early reporting and movement standstill are critical to containment.",
    "Strong colonies and clean storage reduce vulnerability.",
    "DIY chemical use risks legal and non-target consequences."
