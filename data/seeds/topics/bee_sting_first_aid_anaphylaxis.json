{
  "At-a-Glance": "Most stings cause local pain and swelling; remove the sting quickly and cool the area. Rarely, systemic reactions require urgent medical care—plan ahead for yourself and visitors.",
  "Why it Matters": "Preparedness reduces risk on site and reassures landowners and clients. Swift, correct responses limit complications and downtime.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Scrape out the sting within seconds (don’t squeeze the venom sac). Cool packs and oral antihistamines help local reactions. Watch for systemic signs: hives away from the site, swelling of lips/tongue, breathing difficulty, dizziness. Call emergency services for anaphylaxis; administer prescribed adrenaline auto-injector if available; place the person supine with legs raised unless breathing is compromised.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "More incidents occur during peak inspections and hot weather when bees are defensive. Hydration, calm handling, and avoiding strong odours reduce sting risk.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Tweezing and squeezing the venom sac, delaying emergency calls, and working alone without a phone or first-aid kit.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Cold packs, antihistamines, plasters, clean water, charged phone, and adrenaline auto-injector where medically indicated; record incidents in your site log."
