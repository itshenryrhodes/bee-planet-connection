  "Overview": "Varroa destructor remains the single most damaging parasite in modern beekeeping. By feeding on developing and adult bees and vectoring viruses (notably DWV), Varroa suppresses immunity, shortens lifespans, and can push colonies to winter failure. Routine monitoring and well-timed intervention are essential to keep populations below harm thresholds.",
  "Biology & Transmission": "Varroa reproduces in capped brood cells, especially drone brood, completing much of its life cycle under the capping. Phoretic mites ride adult bees, moving between colonies through drifting and robbing. Extended brood rearing (e.g., in warm regions) accelerates mite growth, while brood breaks slow it.",
  "Symptoms & Field Diagnosis": "Tell-tales include deformed wings, spotty brood, and dwindling strength out of line with forage. Use objective counts: sticky boards (daily natural drop), sugar/alcohol washes (% infestation). Many practitioners act at ~2% in mid-season and ~3% by late summer; local guidance should prevail.",
  "Impact on Colony": "Unchecked loads depress worker numbers, spread viruses, and erode winter bee quality. Colonies often collapse late autumn to early spring even with apparent summer vigor.",
  "Control & Treatment": "Adopt an integrated plan: thymol gels post-harvest, oxalic acid during brood-light/broodless windows, formic where permitted and temperature allows, plus biotechnical steps (drone brood removal, splits to create brood breaks). Treat the whole apiary to avoid ‘mite bombs’.",
  "Prevention & Good Practice": "Standardise records, monitor on a schedule (e.g., spring, post-spring flow, post-harvest, autumn), and rotate actives to reduce resistance. Align timing with local nectar flows and climate so winter bees are raised with low mite pressure."
