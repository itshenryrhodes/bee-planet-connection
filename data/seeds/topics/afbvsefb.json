  "Overview": "American foulbrood (AFB) and European foulbrood (EFB) are distinct bacterial brood diseases with different field signs and legal responses. Both can devastate colonies if not handled quickly and correctly.",
  "Biology & Transmission": "AFB (Paenibacillus larvae) forms long-lived spores that persist on equipment for decades. EFB (Melissococcus plutonius) tends to exploit stressed colonies and does not form similarly durable spores. Both spread via contaminated combs, drifting bees, robbing, and beekeeper tools.",
  "Symptoms & Field Diagnosis": "AFB: sunken/greasy cappings, ‘ropey’ larval remains, hard dark scales firmly stuck to cells. EFB: larvae die pre-capping, twisted or melted appearance, sour odour, no ropiness; scales are easier to dislodge. A spotty brood pattern appears in both but the rope test is a key field discriminator.",
  "Impact on Colony": "AFB is typically fatal without eradication; spores reseed disease and can spread silently. EFB can wax and wane with colony strength but still causes significant losses when unmanaged.",
  "Control & Treatment": "Follow local law. AFB commonly requires destruction of bees/frames and sterilisation of hardware. EFB management may include shook swarm, queen replacement, improved nutrition, and (where legal) vet-prescribed antibiotics. Isolate affected colonies and enhance hygiene.",
  "Prevention & Good Practice": "Avoid moving brood combs between apiaries, maintain strong colonies, disinfect tools, and keep detailed health records. Report notifiable disease promptly."
