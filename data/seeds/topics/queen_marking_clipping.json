  "At-a-Glance": "Marking queens improves inspection speed and accuracy; optional wing clipping helps manage swarming. Done carefully, both are low-risk tasks that pay dividends during peak season.",
  "Why it Matters": "Finding the queen quickly speeds diagnostics (e.g., confirming queen-rightness) and reduces rough handling of frames. Clipping can prevent prime swarms from flying far, buying time to intervene.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Gently confine the queen in a marking tube or under a crown-of-thorns cage. Apply a small dot of the year’s colour paint to the thorax; let dry before release. For clipping, remove a small portion of a forewing with fine scissors—steady hands and minimal restraint are key.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Best during calm weather with a light nectar flow when bees are docile. Avoid very cold or very hot days that exacerbate stress.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Over-painting (glueing wings/legs), clipping both forewings, or losing the queen by handling frames over grass. Work above the hive, keep equipment to hand, and practise with drones.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Queen marking pens/paint, marking cage/tube, fine scissors, colour chart for year codes, and a calm, shaded work area."
