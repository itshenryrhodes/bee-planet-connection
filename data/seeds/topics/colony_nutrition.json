  "At-a-Glance": "Balanced nectar and pollen intake underpins immunity, brood rearing, and overwintering. Strategic feeding and forage planning bridge dearths without creating dependency.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Protein shortages stunt brood and weaken winter bees.",
    "Sugar scarcity during rain or drought triggers stress and robbing.",
    "Right nutrition reduces risk from pests and pathogens."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Map seasonal forage and identify gap weeks.",
    "Use supplemental feed only when needed and matched to purpose.",
    "Store and handle feeds hygienically to avoid disease spread."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Weight and brood tracking detect shortages early.",
    "Autumn stores adequate without heavy spring feeding reliance.",
    "Pollen substitutes reserved for genuine dearth or specific objectives (e.g., queen rearing)."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Build a local flow calendar and track hive weights.",
    "2) During dearth: offer light 1:1 syrup to stimulate drawing or maintain brood if appropriate.",
    "3) For stores building in autumn: feed heavier 2:1 syrup until target weights reached.",
    "4) In winter/early spring: use fondant or dry sugar where needed without breaking cluster.",
    "5) Pollen: provide quality patties only when natural pollen is lacking and disease risk is controlled.",
    "6) Stop feeding well before honey supers to prevent contamination."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Drought and cold snaps create surprise gaps even in lush areas.",
    "Urban microclimates can extend forage but also create mid-summer dearths."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Target autumn hive weights per local guidance; log heft differentials.",
    "Brood pattern and pollen basket colour changes signal protein shortages.",
    "Monitor robbing risk when feeding during dearth."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Spotty brood in flow -> Check pollen influx -> Add patties cautiously if natural sources absent.",
    "Symptom: Sudden weight loss in rain week -> Add emergency syrup internally -> Re-assess after 3â€“5 days.",
    "Symptom: Robbing at feeders -> Reduce entrances -> Switch to internal feeding and tidy spills."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Feeding syrup with supers on leading to honey contamination.",
    "Creating chronic dependence by feeding when not needed.",
    "Messy external feeding triggering robbing and disease spread."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Hive scales or regular heft logs, internal frame or top feeders.",
    "Fondant blocks, pollen patty recipes, airtight storage.",
    "Bee-safe water sources with landing surfaces."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Use food-grade containers and clean mixing tools.",
    "Label feed batches and avoid cross-contamination."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Weights/hefts recorded.",
    "Feed type matched to goal.",
    "No open spills, entrances reduced if needed.",
    "Supers removed before syrup feeding."
