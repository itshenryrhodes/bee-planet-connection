  "At-a-Glance": "Planned brood breaks interrupt varroa reproduction and create clean windows for highly effective treatments while supporting queen replacement. Options include caging the queen, making splits, or timed queen removal/reintroduction.",
  "Why it Matters": "Mites reproduce under cappings; a pause starves their cycle, reduces viral load, and boosts treatment efficacy. Aligning a brood break with requeening can refresh genetics and temperament.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Pick method: (1) Cage the queen for ~14 days; treat with OA near the end. (2) Create a nuc/split ensuring one unit is broodless at a defined time; treat that unit. (3) Remove the queen and introduce a mature cell after 4â€“5 days. Keep detailed calendars, verify brood status visually, and treat only the target unit at the optimal moment.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Best during warm stable periods with forage; avoid deep dearth or late autumn unless part of a rescue plan. In continuous-brood climates, brood breaks markedly improve outcomes.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Poor timing, failing to verify broodlessness, and not monitoring mite loads before/after. Ensure adequate food and space to prevent stress.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Queen cage, spare nuc boxes, marked calendar, OA kit where legal, feed, and clear records."
