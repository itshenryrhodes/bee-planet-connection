  "At-a-Glance": "Trap sparingly, dry quickly, and store cold and dark. Colony nutrition comes first.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Prevents brood setbacks and hygienic stress.",
    "Product spoils fast if mishandled."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Use traps only during strong pollen flows.",
    "Cleanly collect and rapidly chill or dry.",
    "Maintain hygiene and traceability."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Traps fitted level and cleaned daily; doors open on off-days.",
    "Pellets collected into clean containers; chilled within hours.",
    "Batch codes with apiary/date; moisture validated."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Confirm strong pollen flow and colony strength; fit trap.",
    "2) Collect daily; remove debris; avoid crushing.",
    "3) Dry ≤40 °C to target moisture or freeze; store opaque/airtight.",
    "4) Rest colonies; remove trap during dearth."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Spring flows best; avoid late-season stress.",
    "Humidity demands faster drying and sealed storage."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Moisture target ≤6–8% for shelf-stable pollen.",
    "Rest ratio (e.g., 2 on / 5 off days) to protect brood."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Brood thinning -> Reduce trapping; feed substitute if needed.",
    "Symptom: Off odour -> Discard; improve speed and drying.",
    "Symptom: Mites in trays -> Improve cleaning and freeze pre-pack."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Continuous trapping through dearth.",
    "Dirty trays and mixed debris.",
    "Slow drying causing mould."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Underfloor/entrance traps, sieves, dehydrator, moisture meter.",
    "Opaque containers and oxygen absorbers."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Food hygiene and allergen labelling for pollen.",
    "Avoid medical claims."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Trap clean and level.",
    "Drying/freezing plan ready.",
    "Batches labelled and logged."
