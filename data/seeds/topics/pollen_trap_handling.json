  "At-a-Glance": "Pollen harvest must be gentle and clean. Use quality traps with bee-friendly screens, run short duty cycles to limit colony impact, and harvest daily in warm spells. Dry promptly at low temperatures to food-safe moisture, sieve out debris, and store airtight and cool to deter pests. Label by date and source. If selling, follow food hygiene norms and avoid health claims. A simple policy—when, how long, and how you dry—keeps bees thriving and product safe and tasty.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Pollen is brood food first. Over-harvesting weakens colonies and sours neighbours if foragers are slowed at the entrance. Duty cycles—on for a few days, off for recovery—balance curiosity with care. Clean handling matters, too: pellets carry field dust and insect parts that must be screened; slow, low drying preserves colour and aroma; and airtight storage prevents moisture uptake and moth damage. A logbook and a scale tell you what the colony can spare across the season. If you share or sell, treat pollen like a delicate food: clean trays, gloves, allergen awareness, and honest labels. Clubs should demonstrate traps sparingly and document settings so new keepers don’t copy worst practices from the internet. Done well, pollen becomes a modest, seasonal treat that does not cost winter strength.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Fit trap; confirm bees pass smoothly; set a conservative duty cycle.",
    "Collect pellets daily; chill or dry promptly.",
    "Dry at low temperature to target moisture; sieve and check visually.",
    "Package in airtight containers; label date/source; store cool.",
    "Log weights and colony condition; adjust or stop as needed."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Your entrance board swaps for a trap on a bright morning. Foragers hesitate for ten minutes, then flow; you watch for jams and adjust. A timer on your phone ends the day’s duty; you remove the drawer, spread pellets on mesh trays, and set a dehydrator at a careful low temperature. Colour holds, aroma remains nutty, and moisture falls to the safe window you calibrated with a simple meter. Pellets pass across a sieve to shed dust and stray legs; anything doubtful is discarded. You pack by date into jars with tight lids and a silica sachet in the outer box. A clean label lists ‘dried bee-collected pollen’, origin, and a batch code that ties back to the log. \n\nThe bees get the priority call. If brood is thin, weather turns, or flight drops, the trap goes away. Your log shows you how little you actually need to collect to satisfy curious friends and loyal customers. When you speak about pollen, you talk about flavour notes, colours, and seasonality—not cures. That tone, plus careful handling, keeps the practice ethical and the product delicious without hurting the colonies that made it.",
