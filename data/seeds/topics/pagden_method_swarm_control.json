  "At-a-Glance": "The Pagden method diverts flying bees by moving the brood box aside and placing the queen with open brood on the original site, reducing swarm pressure while preserving foraging force.",
  "Why it Matters": "A repeatable technique using standard kit; ideal when swarm cells are present and you want to retain crop potential without a permanent split.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Find the queen and place her with one or two frames of eggs/young larvae plus food in a new box on the original stand. Move the old brood box with swarm cells a few metres aside; leave one good cell. Flying bees return to the new box with the queen, reducing pressure. After 7â€“10 days, check for extra cells and ensure space on both units.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Apply at first signs of charged queen cells in spring build-up.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Losing the queen during manipulation, leaving multiple cells in the moved box, and failing to provide enough space for nectar processing.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Spare brood box, frames/foundation, floor, roof, and optional queen excluder."
