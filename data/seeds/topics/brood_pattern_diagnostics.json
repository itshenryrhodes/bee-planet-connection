  "At-a-Glance": "Reading brood patterns turns frames into diagnostics: tight patterns reflect queen and colony health; patchy or bullet cappings signal correctable problems.",
  "Why it Matters": "Early differentiation between queen issues, nutrition, varroa, and brood disease saves weeks and prevents misapplied treatments.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Assess egg presence and age, larval distribution, and capping uniformity. Spotty patterns with sunken or perforated cappings suggest disease; scattered drones in worker cells suggest queen failure or laying workers. Cross-check with mite counts and hygiene tests before acting.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Patterns tighten during strong flows and relax during dearths or cold snaps; interpret in context.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Assuming all spotty brood is a queen defect; skipping mite counts; ignoring ventilation or moisture that chills brood.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Good lighting, magnifier, camera, alcohol or sugar wash kit, diagnostic checklist."
