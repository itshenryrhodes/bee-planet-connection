  "At-a-Glance": "Controlled splits beat walk-away splits for predictable outcomes and timing.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Shortens brood break and restores productivity faster.",
    "Improves queen quality through planned cell/queen use."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Assess donor strength and resources.",
    "2) Controlled: add ripe queen cell or mated queen; Walk-away: rely on emergency cells.",
    "3) Feed if scant nectar; ensure adequate nurse bees.",
    "4) Verify laying pattern after 2–3 weeks (controlled) or 3–4 weeks (walk-away)."

  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Under-resourcing the split",
    "No follow-up confirmation of queenrightness"
