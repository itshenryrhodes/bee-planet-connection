  "At-a-Glance": "Walk-away splits rely on emergency queen rearing; controlled splits use mated queens or ripe cells for predictability. Choose based on timing, goals, and resources.",
  "Why it Matters": "Controlled genetics and faster return to lay reduce brood breaks and lost flows. Walk-away methods are equipment-light but slower and less certain.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Walk-away: divide resources, ensure eggs/young larvae in queenless half, return in ~4 weeks to confirm laying. Controlled: pre-order queens or graft cells; time splits to coincide with strong nurse populations; introduce with cages/push-in over emerging brood.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Best during strong forage and reliable drone availability. Late-season walk-aways risk poor mating and weak build-up.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Under-resourcing the queenless split, poor mating weather, and failing to verify acceptance.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Nuc boxes, caged queens or cells, feeders, calendars, and marking pens."
