  "At-a-Glance": "Wind and edges make rooftops risky—anchor stands, strap stacks, control access, and plan lifts and spills.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Prevents blow-offs and public hazards.",
    "Keeps building managers confident and supportive."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Engineer anchors/ballast for local wind loads.",
    "Design safe access routes and working zones.",
    "Plan spill, swarm, and lift procedures."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Ballasted frames or anchor bolts per roof rules; double straps per hive.",
    "Edge set-back and wind screens; signage and permit.",
    "Lift plan with building/HO; spill kit and escape route."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Survey roof: load limits, wind patterns, anchor points, drainage.",
    "2) Choose stands/ballast; add anti-vibration pads; mark zones.",
    "3) Strap stacks; add wind screens; secure lids and supers.",
    "4) Drill or ballast per policy; document; review after first storm."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Winter gales need extra straps/screens.",
    "Summer heat islands need shade and water top-ups."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Minimum two independent straps; quarterly strap checks.",
    "Set-back distance from edges per building policy."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Vibration complaints -> Add pads; reroute traffic; change hours.",
    "Wind uplift -> Increase ballast; add cross-straps; improve screen.",
    "Drain clog risk -> Keep stands above drains; spill SOP."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Relying on one strap only.",
    "Ignoring roof load and waterproofing rules.",
    "No access permits or induction."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Ratchet straps, anchor plates/ballast tubs, anti-vibration pads.",
    "Wind screens, spill kit, radio/phone access."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Work-at-height rules, induction, edge protection.",
    "Fire/egress routes kept clear."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Anchors/ballast installed and inspected.",
    "Straps tight; lids clipped.",
    "Access/permits up to date."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Brief building teams; share calm hours for inspections."
