  "Overview": "Wind and uplift forces are higher on rooftops. Anchor hives to permanent structure, control sliding, and prevent lid loss.",
  "Types & Variants": "Tie-downs to parapets, ballast frames, anti-vibration pads for HVAC roofs, weatherproof straps with UV-stable buckles.",
  "Using It Well": "Cross-strap brood/supers; secure lids with ratchet straps; add non-slip mats; verify drainage and ballasting do not breach roof warranty.",
  "Costs & Practicalities": "Load limits and wind codes varyâ€”get facilities approval; avoid penetrations.",
  "Recent Innovations": "Modular steel bases with integrated ballast trays and lockable lids."
