  "What It Is": "Comb honey is honey presented in the original wax combâ€”an artisanal product that commands premiums when clean, even, and well-sealed.",
  "Harvesting & Processing": "Use thin surplus foundation or cut-comb cassettes in strong nectar flows to minimise travel stain. Avoid smoke in supers. Handle frames gently; cut and drain at cool temperatures to preserve structure; package in airtight containers to prevent moisture uptake.",
  "Properties & Uses": "Visual appeal and delicate wax are key selling points. Floral source influences flavour, colour, and granulation; some nectars are better suited to comb presentation than others.",
  "Market & Value": "Premium retail channels value provenance and appearance. Control moisture and hygiene; label clearly with lot/date and origin.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Consult cut-comb best-practice for hygiene, packaging films, and retail shelf-life management."
