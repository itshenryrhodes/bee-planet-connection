{
  "What It Is": "Moisture above ~18% risks fermentation; controlling water content preserves flavour and shelf life.",
  "Harvesting & Processing": "Cap only fully sealed combs when possible; use warm rooms/dehumidification to finish uncapped frames; strain and settle gently; measure with a refractometer.",
  "Properties & Uses": "Varietals differ in moisture tendency; heather thixotropy and high-glucose honeys require adapted handling.",
  "Market & Value": "Stable, low-moisture honey retains value and avoids returns; record moisture by batch for quality assurance."
