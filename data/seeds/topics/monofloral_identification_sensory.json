{
  "What It Is": "Monofloral honey claims rest on sensory profile, pollen spectrum, and physicochemical markers. Robust verification protects reputation and price.",
  "Harvesting & Processing": "Segregate supers by apiary and bloom window; sample and label lots meticulously. Use refractometry, colour (Pfund), and aroma notes to triage. Send representative samples for pollen and chemistry when claims matter.",
  "Properties & Uses": "Floral origin influences colour, aroma, enzyme activity, and crystallisation. Sensory panels, when trained, spot off-notes that indicate blend or fermentation risk.",
  "Market & Value": "Verified monoflorals justify premiums; consistency across batches builds buyer confidence. Avoid over-claiming—use ‘predominantly from’ where appropriate.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Align with national honey standards and buyer specifications for monofloral definitions and test thresholds."
