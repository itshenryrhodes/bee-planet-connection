  "At-a-Glance": "Combining a weak unit with a strong, queen-right colony restores efficiency and saves equipment. Newspaper combines are reliable and low-stress when done methodically.",
  "Why it Matters": "Carrying weak, queenless, or defensive colonies through a flow drains time and reduces yard output.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Confirm target colony is queen-right. Kill or remove the failing queen. Stack the queenless box above the queen-right brood nest with a single sheet of newspaper in between; prick a few small holes. Reduce entrances to prevent drift. After 3–5 days, remove paper remnants and tidy frames.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Best during moderate weather with some nectar flow. Avoid combining diseased units—resolve health issues first.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Combining two queens unknowingly, mixing disease without checks, and opening entrances too wide during integration.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Newspaper, knife/nails for pin-pricks, entrance reducers, spare queen excluder if needed for spacing."
