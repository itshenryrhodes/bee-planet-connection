  "At-a-Glance": "Selecting for hygienic behaviour (rapid detection and removal of diseased/infested brood) improves disease resilience and reduces reliance on treatments over time.",
  "Why it Matters": "Colonies with strong hygienic traits limit brood disease spread and may show lower varroa reproduction, creating a foundation for sustainable beekeeping.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Source queens from breeders who test for hygienic traits; evaluate your colonies using pin-kill or freeze-kill brood assays; requeen from top performers; keep simple performance logs (temperament, overwintering, honey yield) to balance traits.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Test during active brood periods with stable weather; repeat assessments across seasons to confirm consistency.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Over-weighting a single trait at the expense of temperament or productivity; skipping re-tests; small sample sizes that mislead selection decisions.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Liquid nitrogen or freeze-kill kits, marking pens, data sheets, and access to breeder stock with transparent testing protocols."
