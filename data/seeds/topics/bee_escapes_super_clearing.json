  "Overview": "Bee escapes create one-way routes that clear supers with minimal stress. Used correctly, they save time and preserve hive temperament during harvest.",
  "Types & Variants": "Porter escapes in crownboards, triangle/oval boards with multiple exits, and fume boards (odour-based) for rapid clearing in warm weather.",
  "Using It Well": "Install escapes in late afternoon, ensuring no brood in supers. Provide an alternative entrance below to prevent congestion. Remove cleared supers early next day. Clean escapes after use and check seals/gaskets for leaks.",
  "Costs & Practicalities": "Escape boards are low cost and durable; fume boards act quickly but require care with odours and temperature.",
  "Recent Innovations": "Improved low-odour clearing agents and better gasket materials reduce leakage and speed clearing.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Harvest SOPs for food safety and odour handling; manufacturer instructions for escape placement and maintenance."
