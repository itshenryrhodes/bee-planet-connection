  "At-a-Glance": "The Snelgrove method manipulates bee movement using a division board with closable entrances, bleeding young bees down to the queen while allowing brood above to emerge. It curbs swarming without losing foraging strength.",
  "Why it Matters": "Compared with simple splits, Snelgrove keeps field force and honey production higher through the main flow while diffusing swarm impulse.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Find and leave the queen with eggs/young brood below. Place the Snelgrove board and brood above with queen cells broken down except one if increase is desired. Open and close specific board entrances over a 7â€“10 day schedule to redistribute flyers. Re-inspect to manage cells and space.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Apply during spring build-up before swarming peaks. Adjust entrance timings for local weather and flows.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Losing track of which entrances are open; leaving multiple queen cells; failing to provide adequate space above/below.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Snelgrove board with gates, queen excluder if required, spare frames/supers, and a clear day-by-day plan."
