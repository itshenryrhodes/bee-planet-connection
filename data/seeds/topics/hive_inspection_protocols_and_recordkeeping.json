  "At-a-Glance": "Consistent inspections with crisp notes power better decisions. Records reveal patterns in swarming, nutrition, disease, and queen performance.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Small issues caught early prevent costly losses.",
    "Comparable records across years improve timing of splits, treatments, and feeding."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Adopt a standard inspection flow and a simple record template.",
    "Capture key metrics in under 5 minutes per colony.",
    "Use records to trigger actions via thresholds."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Inspections scheduled to season (e.g., every 7–9 days in swarm season).",
    "Notes include queen status, brood area, stores, temperament, varroa, actions.",
    "Yard dashboard summarises weights, treatments, and next tasks."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Pre-visit - weather check, objective list, gear check.",
    "2) Opening - 2–3 cool smoke puffs; work methodically from outer frames.",
    "3) Assess - queen/right, eggs/larvae/capped brood, space, queen cells, stores/pollen.",
    "4) Hygiene - manage burr/brace comb into lidded tub; avoid crushing.",
    "5) Decide - actions today (space, split, feed, treat, mark), and schedule follow-up.",
    "6) Record - tick-box template with free-text for anomalies; photo frames if useful."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Spring: rapid changes require tight cadence.",
    "Summer: focus on space, supering, and swarm control.",
    "Autumn: assess stores and mites; consolidate.",
    "Winter: non-invasive checks (heft, entrance observations)."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Swarm control window 7–9 days between checks in peak season.",
    "Varroa and nutrition thresholds link directly to action plans.",
    "Temperament score target 1–2; repeated 4–5 triggers requeening."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Backfilled brood nest -> Add space/super -> Consider split if cells present.",
    "Symptom: Spotty brood -> Check queen age/health and varroa -> Plan requeening or treatment.",
    "Symptom: Light stores -> Feed matched to season (syrup vs fondant)."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Overlong inspections chilling brood.",
    "No clear objective per visit leading to cluttered records.",
    "Recording on scraps that never reach a central log."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Pocket card or app template; colony ID stickers; date-coded queen marks.",
    "Portable scale for quick hefts; voice notes that sync to log.",
    "Colony dashboard (sheet or app) summarising key metrics."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Lift with legs, not back; use helpers for heavy supers.",
    "Respect site rules and PPE; log incidents."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Objective list set.",
    "Smoker fuel and spares packed.",
    "Record template ready (paper/app).",
    "Next actions scheduled before leaving site."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Share seasonal summaries with landowners if helpful."
