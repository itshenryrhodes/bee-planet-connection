{
  "Overview": "Foundation provides preset cell bases for fast, straight comb; foundationless allows natural cell size and reduces wax costs. Each fits different goals.",
  "Types & Variants": "Wired wax, plastic foundation, and starter strips. Foundationless typically uses guides or beveled top bars to encourage straight comb.",
  "Using It Well": "Keep frames dead-square and ensure hives are level. Insert one foundationless frame between straight drawn frames to guide comb. Inspect early to prevent cross-comb.",
  "Costs & Practicalities": "Foundation adds cost but speeds up build; foundationless saves cost/weight but needs more supervision early.",
  "Recent Innovations": "Food-grade plastics and precision-moulded cells improve durability; some producers offer recycled-wax foundation with traceability.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Equipment manuals and peer guides on comb management and frame wiring."
