  "At-a-Glance": "Foundation gives speed and stability—nice, straight comb fast—and simplifies extraction. Foundationless offers wax purity and flexible cell sizes but needs careful management: strong nectar, frames kept level, good spacing and frequent checks to keep comb straight. Many beekeepers blend styles: foundation in brood for order, a few foundationless frames for wax purity or drone management, and foundation in supers for robust extraction. Choose based on your goals (harvest vs wax quality) and how much time you have for comb shepherding.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Comb choices ripple through your season. Foundation accelerates early build-up and keeps novice inspections calmer, but wax sourcing matters—residue-laden foundation undermines the ‘clean comb’ you’re trying to grow. Foundationless maximises control over wax purity and can encourage natural brood distribution, yet wavy comb can waste time and crush bees if neglected. A clear policy lets you enjoy the upsides without the drama: align choices to flow timing (draw during strong nectar), keep frames plumb and tight, and deploy straightening tricks (swap positions, vertical guides) early. A mixed strategy often wins in real apiaries—fast, tidy supers plus pockets of pure wax where you care about residue or specialty products.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Decide zones: brood vs supers; where purity/stability matter most.",
    "If foundationless, install guides (wedges/strips) and keep frames tight/plumb.",
    "Add frames during strong flows so bees draw straight and fast.",
    "Inspect young comb frequently; correct cross-draw early.",
    "Standardise extraction frames on foundation for fewer blowouts."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "The best comb policy is the one you can maintain on a busy June. Foundation makes early season feel easy—box goes on, lines stay straight, extraction day is uneventful. The compromise is trusting the wax supply; many solve this by rendering their own and swapping with known-good sources over time. Foundationless is a craft: you’re asking bees to hang sheets of architecture mid-air, so give them scaffolding—starter strips, tight frame spacing, and a level hive. Add frames into nectar, not dearth; new white comb slumps without income. \n\nCross-draw is a ‘now or never’ fix. If you catch it early, a quick rotate or lift-and-nudge straightens things; leave it and you create a puzzle that burns weekends. A hybrid approach often shines: brood boxes biased to foundation for orderly inspections; a couple of foundationless brood frames for drone management and clean wax; supers on foundation to survive centrifugal force. Over a season you’ll discover your own balance—driven by how fussy your local nectar is, your time budget, and whether you sell wax products that reward purity. Write it down so future-you remembers why you chose what you did.",
