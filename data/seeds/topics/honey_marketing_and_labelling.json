{
  "At-a-Glance": "Clear, compliant labels plus an authentic story move jars. Honest descriptors, batch codes, and clean design build trust and repeat sales.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Regulatory compliance avoids fines and product withdrawals.",
    "Transparent batch coding supports recalls and quality assurance.",
    "Good branding differentiates small producers without spin."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Meet legal labelling: product name, net weight, country of origin, address, best-before, batch code, allergens if applicable.",
    "Adopt a simple batch ledger linking jar codes to apiary/date/moisture.",
    "Tell a concise provenance story: floral sources, neighbourhoods, season."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Readable typography, high-contrast labels, durable adhesive.",
    "Front: product name and net weight; Back: ingredients (‘honey’), origin, best-before, storage, batch, producer contact.",
    "Optional QR linking to batch page with photos and notes."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Define brand system: logo, colours, label sizes for jars/squeezes/miniatures.",
    "2) Create label templates with mandatory fields and variable batch/date fields.",
    "3) Establish batch code format (e.g., BPC-YYYYMMDD-APIARY-##).",
    "4) Print small runs; test adhesion in fridge/wet conditions.",
    "5) Build a simple web page per season or batch with provenance and tasting notes."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Produce soft-set lines for quick-set varietals; explain texture seasonality.",
    "Showcase seasonal limited runs (spring blossom, summer lime) with date stamps."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Moisture reading recorded for each batch (≤18 percent typical).",
    "Weights verified against calibrated scale; spot-check 1 in 20 jars."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Label lift/peeling -> Switch adhesive or jar surface prep -> Reprint affected batch.",
    "Symptom: Customer queries on cloudiness -> Provide crystallisation explainer; offer soft-set.",
    "Symptom: Origin doubts -> Publish batch traceability page; include apiary map."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Using ‘raw’ or health claims that may be restricted.",
    "Missing address/origin or tiny unreadable text.",
    "No batch code on the jar itself."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Calibrated scale, label printer/cutter, batch ledger (sheet/app).",
    "QR code generator to batch pages; moisture refractometer.",
    "Food-safe tamper-evident seals where desired."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Follow local food labelling regulations exactly.",
    "Maintain traceability and recall plan; document batch records."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Label template current and compliant.",
    "Batch code applied and logged.",
    "Best-before and storage guidance present.",
    "Moisture value recorded on batch sheet."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Keep the story concise: where, when, what it tastes like."
