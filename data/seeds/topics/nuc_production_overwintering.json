  "At-a-Glance": "Producing nucleus colonies builds contingency, supports requeening, and creates saleable stock; overwintered nucs jump-start spring build-up.",
  "Why it Matters": "Nucs buffer queen failure, spread risk across yards, and diversify revenue beyond honey.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Split from strong colonies after main spring build; provide 2â€“3 frames of brood, food, and adhering bees; introduce a mated queen or ripe cell; feed to draw comb; site nucs warm and sheltered; aim for 5-frame strength by autumn; overwinter with adequate stores and reduced entrances.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Form in late spring/early summer; ensure enough time to build before winter. In cold regions, consolidate and insulate.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Making nucs too small, poor queen quality, insufficient feeding, and wide entrances inviting robbing.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Nuc boxes, feeders, marked queens/cells, straps, and a build schedule."
