{
  "What It Is": "Creamed (set) honey is intentionally crystallised to a fine, smooth texture using seed inoculation and controlled temperatures.",
  "Harvesting & Processing": "Start with low-moisture honey. Create a fine-grain seed and blend about 5–10%. Hold near 14°C to favour small crystals; stir gently to avoid air. Jar cleanly and store cool to lock texture.",
  "Properties & Uses": "Fine microcrystals produce a spreadable product that resists separation. Floral source influences behaviour; some honeys benefit from blending.",
  "Market & Value": "Consistent texture and provenance attract retail buyers. Label clearly with batch and origin.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Use reputable process charts for temperature/time regimes and checks for granulation stability."
