  "At-a-Glance": "Professional pollination runs on clear roles and repeatable checklists. Agree hive strength definitions and inspection rights, map placements and water sources, set no-spray windows with notification protocols, and document delivery/collection. On arrival, complete acceptance checks (strength, health, queen-right) with signatures from both sides. During bloom, keep comms short and factual—weather, spray intentions, issues. If a spray incident happens, stop, document thoroughly and escalate per contract. A tidy playbook prevents misunderstandings and keeps fruit, farmer and beekeeper aligned.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Pollination is where beekeeping meets agriculture’s moving parts—sprays, irrigation, labour, deadlines. Vague expectations produce conflict: growers expect instant strength; beekeepers expect perfect spray timing; neither gets what they want. A written playbook with SLAs fixes this. Strength metrics and acceptance checks set the baseline; placement and water keep bees where they help most; notification clauses and indemnities turn ‘we hoped’ into ‘we agreed’. When something goes wrong (it will, someday), a pre-agreed incident pathway keeps relationships intact and insurers cooperative. The result is repeat business and calmer seasons for both parties—more fruit set, fewer 2 a.m. phone calls, and bees that work rather than wander.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Define hive strength and inspection/acceptance rights.",
    "Map placements, access and water; confirm counts and dates.",
    "Agree no-spray windows and notification protocol.",
    "Deliver, inspect, and sign acceptance checklists.",
    "Monitor and document; incident log if problems arise."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "A good pollination season reads like a logistics plan: neat lines of hives where bees actually forage, clear tracks for vehicles, and a shared calendar for sprays and irrigations. It starts with language. ‘Eight-frame strength’ means frames covered with adult bees—not a guess. Acceptance happens at delivery, not weeks later; both parties sign and photograph. Water is placed sensibly so bees don’t abandon the crop for a carp pond a field away. \n\nSprays are the sensitive bit. A notification protocol—who calls whom, how long before, what to do if weather shifts—prevents last-minute surprises. If an incident occurs, resist the blame dance; freeze the scene and document: time, products, wind, photos of bee kill and labels, samples if permitted. The contract provides the path from there. Beekeepers who run a grown-up playbook get invited back; growers who do the same get reliable bees. Everyone sleeps better during bloom.",
  
  "Evidence Highlights": [
    "Strength definitions and acceptance checks reduce disputes.",
    "Mapped placements and on-site water improve pollination efficiency.",
    "Notification/no-spray clauses reduce spray incidents and losses.",
    "Incident logs with photos and timings support fair resolution."

  "FAQs": [
    {"q": "What’s a fair strength spec?", "a": "Often ≥8 frames of adult bees per hive; agree locally and put it in writing."},
    {"q": "How much lead time for sprays?", "a": "Agree a minimum (e.g., 24–48 h) with a named contact chain."}
  ],

  "Seasonality & Climate": "Bloom windows are tight; align deliveries with actual bud stages. Heat and wind alter bee flight—adjust placements accordingly.",
