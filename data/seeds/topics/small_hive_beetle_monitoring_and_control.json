  "At-a-Glance": "Aethina tumida (small hive beetle) can slime comb and collapse colonies in affected regions. Vigilance, strong colonies, and traps reduce impact; movement controls limit spread.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "SHB larvae destroy comb and contaminate honey with fermentation slime.",
    "Adults hide in crevices; weak colonies are most at risk.",
    "Early detection and swift action prevent apiary-wide losses."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Know local SHB status and reporting rules.",
    "Maintain strong colonies with minimal excess space.",
    "Deploy traps and hygienic practices in risk zones."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Regular bottom board checks and trap monitoring.",
    "Tight box space matching population; prompt removal of dead-outs.",
    "Clean extraction spaces with no honey spills."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Monitoring: inspect under frames, in corners, and on bottom boards; use corrugated insert traps or oil traps.",
    "2) If found: reduce space to cluster size; add traps; remove honey supers if slimed; freeze affected frames if salvageable.",
    "3) Apiary hygiene: remove cappings and waste daily; seal bins.",
    "4) Movement control: avoid moving equipment from infected yards; follow official guidance.",
    "5) Follow-up: recheck weekly until populations drop; strengthen colonies with brood if appropriate."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Warm, humid conditions favour SHB reproduction.",
    "Cooler seasons slow breeding but do not eliminate risk."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Any confirmed SHB in a new area may be reportable; check local rules.",
    "Trap counts trending up week-on-week trigger intensified control."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Slime and sour odour -> Isolate and chill or freeze frames -> Remove honey from beesâ€™ access -> Clean boxes.",
    "Symptom: Adults persist despite traps -> Reduce space and shade; increase trap density; reassess colony strength.",
    "Symptom: Recurrent SHB after moves -> Review transport sanitation and receiving yard hygiene."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Leaving extracted supers exposed, drawing adults to yards.",
    "Over-supering weak colonies creating beetle refuges.",
    "Moving suspect equipment between apiaries."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Oil traps, beetle blasters, corrugated inserts, diatomaceous earth under stands where appropriate.",
    "Freezers for salvage; sealed waste bins; bleach for floors in extraction rooms."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Follow local reporting protocols and approved control options.",
    "Dispose of slimed honey and waste responsibly."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Traps in place and dated.",
    "Boxes sized to population.",
    "Waste sealed; floor clean.",
    "Movement logs updated."
