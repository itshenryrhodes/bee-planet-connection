  "At-a-Glance": "Oxalic acid (OA) is a core varroa control used during brood-light or broodless windows. Correct timing and delivery (dribble or vapour) make it highly effective when label-compliant.",
  "Why it Matters": "Treating when mites are mainly phoretic maximises contact. Lowering autumn loads protects winter bees and improves overwintering.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Confirm brood status; choose method per local approval. Trickle: mix approved syrup concentration; apply measured dose per seam. Vapour: seal appropriately; apply dose with a certified device; observe re-entry interval. Record batch, dose, and date.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Best post-harvest when brood is low or during induced/natural brood breaks. In warm regions with continuous brood, plan a biotechnical break to raise efficacy.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Over-dosing, treating heavy open brood (poor efficacy), inadequate PPE, and ignoring legal use patterns.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Calibrated syringe/measurer, approved OA product, vaporiser where legal, PPE, entrance seals, timer, logbook."
