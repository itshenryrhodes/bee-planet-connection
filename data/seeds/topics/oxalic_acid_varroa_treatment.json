  "At-a-Glance": "Oxalic acid works best on broodless colonies. Choose trickle or vaporisation per kit, timing, and legal rules.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "High efficacy during brood breaks or winter.",
    "Low residue risk when used correctly."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Standardise dose, PPE, and delivery method.",
    "Schedule for broodless windows where possible.",
    "Record lots, doses, and outcomes."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Broodless timing targeted; correct dose per seam/colony.",
    "Vapour kit checked; masks and eye protection used.",
    "Post-treatment counts confirm reduction."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Confirm brood status; pick trickle or vapour method.",
    "2) Prepare dose; seal entrances for vapour if required.",
    "3) Apply per label; ventilate; note times and weather.",
    "4) Verify after 3â€“7 days with sampling or drop."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Winter/induced brood breaks are ideal windows.",
    "Avoid rain/wind for vapour work."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Dose per seam or per colony as labelled.",
    "Expected post-treatment reduction range."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Low effect -> Brood present or poor contact; retime or change method.",
    "Irritation -> Check dose and temperature; improve ventilation."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Treating with heavy brood present.",
    "Skipping PPE for vapour.",
    "Confusing grams with millilitres."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "OA crystals/solution, calibrated syringe/spoon, vapouriser, seal cloths.",
    "Timer, mask, goggles, gloves."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Follow label, PPE, and site safety rules.",
    "Record treatments for inspections."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Broodless window confirmed.",
    "Dose prepared; PPE on.",
    "Follow-up sampling scheduled."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain why broodless timing matters for efficacy."
