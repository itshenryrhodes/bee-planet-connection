  "At-a-Glance": "Thermal imaging detects brood patterns and colony health without opening hives.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Minimises hive disturbance.",
    "Quick screening for queenrightness and cluster size."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Use handheld or drone-mounted thermal camera.",
    "2) Capture images in early morning or evening for contrast.",
    "3) Compare thermal patterns with known healthy baselines."
