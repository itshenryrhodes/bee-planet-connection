  "At-a-Glance": "Thermal cameras reveal cluster position, heat leaks, and moisture risks—use for triage, not as a sole diagnostic.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Non-invasive winter checks reduce stress.",
    "Finds heat/moisture problems you cannot see."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Standardise distance, angle, and time for shots.",
    "Interpret patterns (cluster, heat leaks, empty boxes).",
    "Link findings to actions (insulation, ventilation, feed)."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Consistent outside shots at dusk/dawn; reference panel used.",
    "Photos named by yard-hive-date; notes with actions.",
    "Follow-ups confirm changes on next scan."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Calibrate and set emissivity; add a known reference (card).",
    "2) Shoot front/sides at set distance; avoid sun/wind bias.",
    "3) Interpret: cluster high/low; cold corners; condensation signs.",
    "4) Act: adjust insulation/vent; verify food; note for spring."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Best in cold, still conditions; poor in direct sun.",
    "After storms, recheck straps/lids/heat loss."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Cluster height vs feed position guide.",
    "Heat leak threshold for intervention (relative)."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Hot crownboard edge -> Lid gap; fix and re-scan.",
    "Cold box, no cluster -> Dead-out or abscond; confirm gently.",
    "Cluster low late winter -> Risk of starvation above; add fondant."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Over-interpreting noisy images.",
    "Scanning in sun or wind.",
    "No before/after photos to prove change."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Handheld thermal cam or phone module; reference card.",
    "Simple photo naming scheme and folder."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Roof/ladder safety; avoid night hazards.",
    "Respect site permissions and privacy."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Camera set; reference ready.",
    "Angles/distance consistent.",
    "Actions logged post-scan."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Set expectations: triage tool, not x-ray vision."
