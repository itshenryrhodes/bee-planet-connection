{
  "Overview": "Handheld thermal cameras and smartphone IR add non-invasive insight into winter clustering, heat loss points, and post-treatment activity patterns.",
  "Types & Variants": "Clip-on phone modules, handheld imagers with adjustable palettes, and fixed sensors on research hives. Resolution and refresh rate drive usefulness.",
  "Using It Well": "Scan in calm conditions; avoid direct sun glare. Compare colonies rather than fixating on absolute temperatures. Confirm anomalies with a quick, minimal-disturbance inspection.",
  "Costs & Practicalities": "Entry-level modules are affordable and adequate for trend spotting. Protect lenses from propolis/wax; store dry. Data images are lightweight for records.",
  "Recent Innovations": "Automated alerts for cluster movement and brood re-start; paired weightâ€“thermal dashboards flag queen loss sooner than manual checks.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Manufacturer guides and extension notes on interpreting IR for bee applications."
