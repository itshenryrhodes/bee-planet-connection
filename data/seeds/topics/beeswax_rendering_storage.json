  "At-a-Glance": "Store wax dry, dark, cool, and labelled. Protect from moths, odours, and contamination.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Preserves colour and aroma.",
    "Prevents pest damage and taints."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Label cakes by source and render date.",
    "Use sealed, odour-free containers and liners.",
    "Implement moth deterrence and stock rotation."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Opaque boxes with parchment liners; silica gel for humidity control.",
    "Deterrents (freezing cycles, clean storage, cedars) as appropriate.",
    "FIFO rotation and cleanliness."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Cool fully; scrape bottoms; label cakes.",
    "2) Pack with liners; seal; store away from strong odours.",
    "3) Freeze suspect batches pre-storage; inspect quarterly.",
    "4) Record withdrawals to candle/cosmetic production."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Summer moth pressure higher—freeze more, inspect more.",
    "Damp sheds taint wax—move to dry, cool space."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Relative humidity target ≤60% in storage.",
    "Inspection cadence at least quarterly."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Moth webbing -> Freeze; clean; review sealing and hygiene.",
    "Symptom: Off-odour -> Remove from source; re-render if safe.",
    "Symptom: Bloom on surface -> Normal; gently buff or warm lightly."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Perfumed rooms or detergents near wax.",
    "Cardboard that wicks moisture and odours.",
    "No labels linking to source grade."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Opaque bins, liners, silica gel, freezer, inventory log.",
    "Bloom cloths and gentle warming box."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Separate cosmetic vs food-contact grades.",
    "Keep pests and chemicals away from storage."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Boxes sealed and labelled.",
    "Environment dry, dark, cool.",
    "Quarterly check recorded."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Tell buyers how you store for quality."
