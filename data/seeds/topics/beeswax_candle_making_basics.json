  "What It Is": "Beeswax candles offer bright, drip-resistant flames with natural aroma when wick size and wax prep are right.",
  "Harvesting & Processing": "Filter wax progressively; avoid overheating that darkens and reduces viscosity. Choose wick size/ply for mould diameter; test-burn samples before production. Add nothing or only approved colourants; label accordingly.",
  "Properties & Uses": "Beeswax has a higher melting point than many waxes; correct wick sizing prevents tunnelling or sooting. Moulded vs dipped candles need different cooling routines to avoid cracks.",
  "Market & Value": "Premium artisanal productâ€”appearance, scent, and clean burn drive repeat sales. Provide burn-time guidance and safety labels.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Use reputable candle-making charts for wick sizing and safety labelling standards."
