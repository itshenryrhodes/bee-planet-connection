  "At-a-Glance": "Simple hygiene habits reduce disease transmission: clean tools, frame discipline, sensible movement of bees and equipment, and tidy extraction practices.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Low hygiene increases risk of spreading brood disease and pests between colonies and apiaries.",
    "Clean kit speeds inspections and improves product quality."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Standardise tool cleaning between yards; avoid sharing suspect frames.",
    "Quarantine new colonies and used equipment before integration.",
    "Keep extraction rooms food-safe with clear flows for clean/dirty kit."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Dedicated toolbox per yard or stringent clean-down between sites.",
    "Frames labelled by colony/year; no casual frame swapping.",
    "Wax, propolis, and cappings stored in sealed containers."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Pre-visit - pack clean tools, spare gloves, disinfectant wipes/spray.",
    "2) During inspection - keep brace/burr comb in a lidded tub; avoid dropping comb.",
    "3) Suspect disease - isolate kit, mark colony, stop frame transfers, contact inspector as required.",
    "4) Post-visit - flame hive tool/scraper where appropriate; wash suits regularly.",
    "5) Extraction - one-way flow from uncapping to bottling; cover tanks; manage spills immediately."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Warm months increase pathogen growth; intensify cleaning cadence.",
    "Rainy spells increase mud/contamination risk around stands and entrances."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Cleaning log per yard (date, method).",
    "Zero tolerance for sharing frames from suspect colonies."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Recurrent chalkbrood or foul odours -> Review ventilation and hygiene -> Replace old comb cycle.",
    "Symptom: Sticky robbing events -> Tighten entrances, remove exposed honey, clean area.",
    "Symptom: Visible mould on equipment -> Dry and disinfect; improve storage ventilation."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Mixing frames across colonies routinely.",
    "Leaving cappings/honey exposed to robbers.",
    "Reusing second-hand equipment without thorough inspection/cleaning."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Flame gun where safe, washing station, disinfectant approved for food areas.",
    "Comb cycle plan (replace oldest 1/3 each season).",
    "Seal-able tubs and bags for waste and wax."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Follow national disease reporting rules.",
    "Use food-safe cleaners in extraction spaces; document sanitation."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Clean tools packed.",
    "Waste/wax tubs with lids.",
    "Spare nitrile gloves and wipes.",
    "Comb cycle notes updated."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain to stakeholders why hygiene lowers chemical reliance."
