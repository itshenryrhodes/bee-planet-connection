  "At-a-Glance": "A disciplined comb cycle improves brood health, reduces residues, and keeps inspections smooth. Replace oldest, darkest brood comb regularly.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Old comb harbours pathogens and pesticide residues.",
    "Well-managed comb yields straighter brood patterns and faster work.",
    "Fresh comb supports queen laying and colony productivity."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Adopt a comb replacement plan (e.g., 1/3 of brood comb per season).",
    "Standardise frame marking by year for easy rotation.",
    "Prevent cross-colony frame mixing except where planned."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Frames dated/colour-coded on top bars.",
    "Dark, heavy brood comb steadily removed to wax rendering.",
    "Straight, fully drawn worker comb in brood nest; drone comb placed intentionally."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Audit: mark frames by age; list target removals.",
    "2) Insert foundation/comb: place near brood to guide straight draw.",
    "3) Use drone foundation strategically for varroa trapping if needed.",
    "4) Remove old comb after emergence; avoid removing all at once.",
    "5) Render old wax; segregate brood wax from cappings for quality."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Most replacement during spring build-up and early summer.",
    "Avoid major comb swaps during dearth or cold snaps."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Target: replace 30–40 percent of brood comb annually.",
    "Visible sagging, blackened cells, or patchy brood signal priority removal."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Patchy brood on dark comb -> Replace frames; check varroa and queen.",
    "Symptom: Cross comb in supers -> Add guides; re-space; correct before filling.",
    "Symptom: Drone-heavy brood -> Verify foundation; correct nest layout."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Bulk removal creating brood nest shock.",
    "Unmarked frames leading to guesswork.",
    "Mixing suspect frames between colonies."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Frame year markers, spacing tools, wiring kit if needed.",
    "Foundation of correct cell size; jig for straight assembly.",
    "Wax melter; filter cloth for rendering."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Biosecurity when discarding suspect comb; follow disease reporting rules.",
    "Food-grade handling of cappings vs brood wax streams."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Frames dated and logged.",
    "Oldest third identified.",
    "Replacement frames built and ready.",
    "Wax rendering plan set."
