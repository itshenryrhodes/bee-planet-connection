{
  "At-a-Glance": "Colonies long queenless may develop laying workers producing multiple eggs per cell and drone brood in worker cells. Recovery requires stabilising pheromones and paced queen introduction.",
  "Why it Matters": "Without intervention, colonies spiral down: no worker brood, dwindling population, and aggressive temperament.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Confirm diagnosis (multiple eggs, bullet cappings, chaotic pattern). Add a frame of open brood weekly for 2â€“3 weeks to suppress laying workers. Combine with a queen-right nuc via newspaper or introduce a caged queen using a push-in cage over emerging brood. Verify eggs/laying pattern after release.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Best during nectar flows and mild weather; late-season attempts may fail due to low population and poor acceptance.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Introducing a queen too early; failing to verify queenlessness; not providing open brood to reset pheromones.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Frames of open brood, push-in cage, caged queen, newspaper for combines, logbook."
