  "Snapshot": "Transparent, compliant labels build trust and protect sales across retail and wholesale. Core elements typically include product name, net quantity, lot/batch, best-before, producer/packer name and address, and country of origin.",
  "Supply & Demand": "Buyers increasingly expect provenance, floral type where claimed, and clear allergy/ingredient statements for blended products. Traceability underpins premium pricing and recall readiness.",
  "Revenue Streams": "Compliant labelling opens access to more retailers and export channels. Monofloral and single-apiary lines benefit from batch storytelling and QR-linked traceability.",
  "Risks & Compliance": "Know local rules on composition terms (e.g., reserved names), nutrition/health claims, font sizes, and date formats. Keep batch records tying jars to extraction runs and apiaries; align with food hygiene registration where applicable.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Consult your jurisdictionâ€™s food labelling codes and honey standards; align internal QA checklists to those requirements before print runs.",
