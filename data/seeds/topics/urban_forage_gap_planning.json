{
  "Overview": "City bloom is patchy. Map micro-flows (street trees, parks, balconies) to bridge dearths with planting and feeding plans.",
  "Drivers & Mechanisms": "Early: willow/ornamentals; mid: lime/parks; late: ivy/rooftop planters. Drought and mowing policy shift timing.",
  "Mitigation & Best Practice": "Coordinate with building managers for planter choices; stagger blooms; avoid pesticide-treated ornamentals."
