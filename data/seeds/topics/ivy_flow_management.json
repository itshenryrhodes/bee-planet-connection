  "At-a-Glance": "Autumn ivy nectar can add weight fast and stimulate brood but granulates hard. Manage space and timing to balance winter stores with spring usability.",
  "Why it Matters": "Excess ivy honey in brood boxes can block spring build-up; conversely it is a valuable late flow to secure winter stores.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Monitor weight and brood nest position in early autumn. Leave room for stores without over-supering. Reserve ivy honey for winter feed frames where useful and harvest only suitable, low-moisture batches. Position fondant as insurance if weather turns.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Ivy blooms late (often Sept–Nov). Cool, damp weather narrows foraging windows; strong days can produce sudden weight gains—recheck space frequently.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Extracting high-moisture ivy that ferments; allowing stores to wall-in the brood nest; removing too much late feed.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Hive scales, spare frames/supers, refractometer, insulated crownboard or candy boards."
