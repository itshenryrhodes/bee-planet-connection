{
  "Overview": "Stonebrood is a fungal infection (Aspergillus spp.) of honey bee brood that can harden larvae into rock-like mummies. Though uncommon, it warrants careful hygiene due to potential human health concerns.",
  "Biology & Transmission": "Spores are ubiquitous in soil and organic debris; infection is favoured by damp conditions and stressed colonies. Some species can produce mycotoxins.",
  "Symptoms & Field Diagnosis": "Mummies are firm and often greenish or black with powdery surfaces; distinguish from chalkbrood (white/grey, friable). Handle samples cautiously and seek lab confirmation.",
  "Impact on Colony": "Usually localised but can reduce brood viability; serious cases indicate broader moisture or hygiene problems needing correction.",
  "Control & Treatment": "Improve ventilation and dryness; remove and destroy affected comb; replace with clean foundation. Use PPE when handling suspect material; follow local guidance if lab-confirmed.",
  "Prevention & Good Practice": "Keep interiors dry, avoid mouldy stores, rotate old comb, and maintain clean extraction/storage areas nearby to limit spore loads."
