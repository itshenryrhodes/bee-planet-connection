  "At-a-Glance": "Heat-based treatments target mites/eggs with varying efficacy—equipment-intensive and timing-sensitive.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Non-chemical option within IPM.",
    "Mixed field results require cautious expectations."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Understand devices, protocols, and realistic outcomes.",
    "Identify safe timing relative to brood stage and flows.",
    "Decide when thermal fits vs OA/formic/thymol."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Documented protocol; calibrated device; safe handling.",
    "Brood-stage-aware timing; follow-up sampling.",
    "Clear go/no-go criteria to avoid thermal stress."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Review device requirements and independent trials.",
    "2) Calibrate temperature sensors; pre-brief team.",
    "3) Treat per protocol; monitor bee behaviour closely.",
    "4) Re-sample; compare to chemical alternatives."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Cool ambient simplifies temperature control; heat waves risky.",
    "Consider brood cycle—egg/larval targets vary."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Temperature/time targets per device; tolerance bands.",
    "Efficacy benchmark vs recent OA/formic outcomes."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Overheating signs -> Abort; ventilate; provide water; re-evaluate.",
    "Low efficacy -> Device calibration; brood stage mismatch; method change.",
    "Excess stress -> Switch to chemical option with better risk profile."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Assuming lab efficacy equals field results.",
    "Poor calibration and uneven heat.",
    "Trying during peak flows without resources."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Thermal device, reference thermometer, data logger.",
    "Checklists and timers; shade and water ready."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Electrical safety; fire precautions.",
    "Do not exceed manufacturer limits."

  "Field Checklist": [
    "Device calibrated.",
    "Ambient conditions acceptable.",
