{
  "At-a-Glance": "Thymol formulations provide post-harvest varroa knock-down at moderate temperatures and fit well into rotation plans to slow resistance.",
  "Why it Matters": "Using a non-synthetic mode of action outside the main nectar flow reduces contamination risk and diversifies the treatment toolbox.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Remove honey supers. Place gels or strips per label, ensuring bee space and airflow. Monitor behaviour and ambient temperature. Replace or rotate pads as directed. Verify reduction with a post-treatment mite count.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Most labels specify efficacy windows (often around 15–30°C). In cooler or very hot periods, efficacy or tolerance may drop—schedule accordingly.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Leaving supers on, poor ventilation causing stress, and failing to verify results. Avoid stacking strong odour treatments back-to-back.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Approved thymol product, spacers, thermometer, mite monitoring kit, records."
