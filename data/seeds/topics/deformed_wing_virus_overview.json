  "Overview": "Deformed Wing Virus (DWV) is a ubiquitous honey bee virus strongly associated with Varroa destructor. Clinical cases show shrunken, crumpled wings and shortened lifespans, but subclinical infections can still depress colony performance. Managing DWV is primarily about suppressing mite vectors and maintaining strong, well-fed colonies.",
  "Biology & Transmission": "DWV circulates horizontally via trophallaxis and contaminated comb, but the most consequential route is Varroa-mediated transmission directly into haemolymph. This amplifies viral load and selects for more virulent strains. Overwintering bees with high DWV titres perform poorly, undermining spring build-up.",
  "Symptoms & Field Diagnosis": "Classic signs include newly emerged adults with deformed or missing wings, shortened abdomens, and inability to fly. However, many infections are covert; use mite counts and colony performance indicators (brood pattern, forager return rates) to infer pressure.",
  "Impact on Colony": "High DWV load shortens worker longevity, reduces foraging, and can drive late-autumn/early-spring collapses. Synergies with other stressors (nutrition, pesticides) compound risk and may produce outsized losses even when brood looks acceptable mid-season.",
  "Control & Treatment": "There is no direct antiviral field treatment in common beekeeping practice. Focus on Integrated Pest Management for Varroa (timely OA/formic/thymol or biotechnical brood breaks), retiring old brood comb, and ensuring adequate nutrition during critical rearing windows.",
  "Prevention & Good Practice": "Keep mite loads below thresholds before winter bees are raised; avoid swapping suspect frames between apiaries; select for hygienic stock and stable overwintering performance."
