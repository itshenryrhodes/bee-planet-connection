  "What It Is": "Beeswax accumulates environmental residues over time. Proactive comb rotation and careful sourcing of foundation manage risk for both bee health and product quality.",
  "Harvesting & Processing": "Segregate cappings (cleaner) from brood wax. Render gently; filter progressively. Keep batch records linking wax to yards and seasons. When purchasing foundation, request residue testing statements if available.",
  "Properties & Uses": "Old brood wax darkens and carries higher residue loads; cappings wax fetches higher cosmetic grades. Transparency on source and handling builds trust.",
  "Market & Value": "Brands that evidence clean wax and traceability command premiums. Recycling your own cappings into foundation closes loops if quality controls are strong.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Consult recognised residue monitoring programs and quality standards for cosmetic/food-contact beeswax."
