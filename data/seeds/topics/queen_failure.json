  "At-a-Glance": "Spotty brood, scattered drones in worker cells, and persistent queen cells point to a failing or absent queen.",
  "Why it Matters": "Late recognition leads to population collapse just as flows arrive or winter approaches.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Confirm status: look for eggs/larvae; assess brood pattern and behaviour (nervous ‘roar’). If failing: remove old queen, introduce a caged, mated queen with candy release in the brood area; check acceptance and egg-laying after a few days.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Introducing a new queen without removing the old; skipping acclimatisation; attempting requeening during severe dearth with aggressive colonies.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Marked queens/queen cells, introduction cages, fondant, and calm technique."
