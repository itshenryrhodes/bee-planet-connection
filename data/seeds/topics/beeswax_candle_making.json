  "At-a-Glance": "Beeswax candles shine when wick and wax match. Render clean wax, melt in a double boiler, and pour at the right temperature to minimise sinkholes and frosting. Choose wick size by diameter and mould type; test-burn and trim to avoid smoke and tunnelling. Prime wicks, warm moulds, and cool slowly. Label with burn guidance and CLP if you add fragrance. Store cool and dust-free to keep a soft bloom rather than grime. A small, repeatable SOP gives you neat pillars, tea-lights and tapers that light first time and burn evenly at the stall and at home.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Candles are the friendliest way to turn wax into value, yet most frustration comes from mismatched wicks or overheated pours. Beeswax is dense and needs the right wick surface area to draw fuel without smoking; under-wicked pillars tunnel, over-wicked ones mushroom and soot. Temperature management protects aroma and appearance: a gentle melt avoids scorching, warmed moulds reduce shock lines, and patient cooling prevents hollows. Safety drives the setup: no naked-flame heating, clear labelling, and a tidy pour space. A simple test-burn log saves money—the first few samples tell you which wick sizes and pour temps your mould range needs. Add clear instructions on labels (first burn time, trimming, holder/surface notes) for customer safety and satisfaction. When your method is calm and consistent, you reduce rework, present a tidy range, and keep a clean reputation with repeat buyers and venues.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Melt filtered wax in a double boiler; avoid direct heat.",
    "Pre-warm moulds; fit and anchor wicks; prime if using raw wick.",
    "Pour at target temperature; tap to release bubbles.",
    "Cool slowly; re-pour tops if needed; de-mould and trim.",
    "Label with burn guidance; test-burn and log outcomes."

  "Context & Narrative": "Set the bench like a tiny factory: bain-marie on low heat, jug thermometer, moulds lined on a tray, and a box of pre-cut wicks by size. You pick a pillar mould, thread the wick, and seal the base with a dab of putty. Wax melts gently—no smoke, no smell of hot sugar—then rests to your pour temperature so the crystal structure sets clean. The first pour leaves a small contraction well; you top it off later for a flat base. Tapers pull straight from a dip-can rhythm—count, lift, cool, repeat—while tea-lights fill on a silicone tray in a calm, steady hand. \n\nA test-burn sheet sits by a fireproof plate. You record diameter, wick code, and behaviour every 30 minutes: flame size, edge melt, any mushrooming. Two burns teach you more than ten guess-pours. The best-performing combination becomes your default, and the label tells buyers what you learned: trim to 5–7 mm, burn 2–3 hours first time to set memory, keep on a heatproof surface. If you add fragrance to blends, you follow CLP rules and list hazards as required. Finished stock cures under covers to avoid dust; a soft natural bloom is a selling point, not a flaw. With this cadence, your winter table looks deliberate: uniform heights, even tops, and a little card that says ‘Made from our own beeswax, hand-poured in small batches’.",
