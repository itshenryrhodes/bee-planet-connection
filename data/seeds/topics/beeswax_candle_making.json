  "At-a-Glance": "Beeswax candles need clean wax, correct wick sizing, and steady pour temperatures for a clean burn and minimal frosting.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Turns wax into a profitable, low-waste product.",
    "Quality candles reinforce brand perception."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Match wick to wax type, diameter, and mold.",
    "Control melt/pour temps and cooling to reduce defects.",
    "Label and test-burn every new size/format."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Filtered cappings wax for pale pillars and tapers; brood-wax blends for rustic tones.",
    "Consistent wicks and molds labelled by size.",
    "Even burn pool without tunnelling or excessive drip."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Prepare wax: render and filter; keep water out; record batch.",
    "2) Wick selection: start from supplier charts; test and adjust.",
    "3) Heat: melt in double boiler; typical pour ~62–70 °C; pre-warm molds.",
    "4) Pour: steady stream; avoid bubbles; top up sinkholes after initial set.",
    "5) Cure and test-burn; label with burn guidance and batch."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Cold rooms cause frosting and sinkholes; warm gently to reduce.",
    "Hot rooms soften tapers—store cool and upright."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Record wick codes, diameters, temps, and results.",
    "Aim for full melt pool by 2–3 h on pillars; adjust wick if tunnelling."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Tunnelling -> Up-size wick; increase burn time on first burn.",
    "Symptom: Sooting -> Down-size wick; lower draft; trim wicks.",
    "Symptom: Frosting -> Warmer pour or slower cooling; polish surface lightly."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Pouring too cool/warm leading to surface defects.",
    "Wrong wick for diameter or wax type.",
    "No test-burn before selling."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Double boiler, thermometer, molds, wick tabs/pins, heat gun for finishing.",
    "Wick sizing charts; logbook for tests."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Fire safety when melting; never leave wax heating unattended.",
    "CLP/label guidance where required; burn warnings and base protection."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Wax batch filtered; molds clean.",
    "Correct wicks staged and labelled.",
    "Test-burn samples logged."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Provide clear burn-care cards with each candle."
