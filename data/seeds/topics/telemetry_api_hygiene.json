  "At-a-Glance": "Treat hive data like food data: clean inputs, clear ownership, and minimal personal info. Build small, reliable pipelines.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Messy telemetry wastes time and misleads decisions.",
    "Privacy and trust matter for sites and partners."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Document data sources, owners, and retention.",
    "Validate and de-duplicate before charts.",
    "Automate tiny—alert only what you act on."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "One CSV/app of record; backups; versioned dashboards.",
    "Simple alert rules with on/off times.",
    "Access limited; keys rotated; sites anonymised."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Map sensors and data paths; assign owners.",
    "2) Validate ranges; drop junk; fill gaps visibly.",
    "3) Build small alerts; test; log actions.",
    "4) Review quarterly; prune dead streams."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Battery and temp cause gaps—design tolerance.",
    "Storms = outages—catch-up logic needed."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Validation rules (min/max, rate of change).",
    "Retention policy and backup cadence."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Alert fatigue -> Raise thresholds; silence when on site.",
    "Data drift -> Recalibrate sensors; note firmware changes.",
    "Privacy risk -> Remove precise coords; aggregate."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Charts without decisions.",
    "Public dashboards with exact hive locations.",
    "Secret keys in repos."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "CSV + cron, lightweight DB, or sheets; secrets manager.",
    "Unit tests for transforms; health pings."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Data protection basics; minimal personal/site data.",
    "Incident logs for outages and breaches."
