  "At-a-Glance": "Urban yards succeed on soft skills: proactive neighbour comms, tidy kit, swift complaint handling, and predictable inspection hours.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Perception drives permissions; a single sting incident can shutter multiple sites.",
    "Goodwill opens doors to rooftops, community gardens, and corporate ESG sites."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Minimise nuisance (beelines, bearding, water-seeking) with siting and water.",
    "Create a simple comms pack: welcome note, emergency contact, swarm guidance.",
    "Keep inspections during office hours except for emergencies."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Discreet hives screened from sightlines; entrances away from walkways.",
    "Clean, compact kit storage; no burr comb left out.",
    "Water source closer than neighboursâ€™ pools and birdbaths.",
    "Incident log with dates, actions, and follow-ups."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Pre-placement walkaround with site owner; agree locations and access.",
    "2) Welcome sheet to immediate neighbours with contact and swarm instructions.",
    "3) Water and forage plan; plant bee-friendly species on site where possible.",
    "4) Inspection cadence posted (e.g., Tue mornings) to manage expectations.",
    "5) Complaints protocol: acknowledge same day, investigate, act, close the loop.",
    "6) Annual review: share positive metrics (pollinator planting, honey donations)."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Summer dearth increases water-seeking and defensiveness; top up water daily.",
    "Storm heatwaves can cause bearding; add shade and ventilation to reduce street-level concern."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Keep follow-bee reports to near zero via screens and siting.",
    "Respond to complaints within 24 hours with a documented action."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Bees at neighbour pool -> Improve on-site water (float surfaces, mineral pinch) -> Re-aim entrances.",
    "Symptom: Frequent follow-bees -> Raise screen/fence, adjust inspection time and smoke usage.",
    "Symptom: Swarm sighted -> Deploy swarm plan; communicate outcome to neighbours."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Open feeding and sticky cappings attracting robbing.",
    "Evening/dusk inspections increasing follow-bees.",
    "Unannounced swarm control visits with visible disruption."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Printed neighbour cards, QR to swarm guidance page.",
    "Water tubs with corks/pebbles; drip irrigation timer.",
    "Privacy screens or trellis planters."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Follow local ordinances/landlord rules; rooftop fall protection.",
    "Log incidents; keep liability insurance where applicable."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Water refreshed.",
    "Screens intact; entrances safe.",
    "Next inspection time posted.",
    "Comms kit in bag (cards, tape, signage)."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Use calm, factual tone; share pollinator planting tips."
