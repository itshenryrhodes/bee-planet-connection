  "What It Is": "Ling heather yields thixotropic honey that gels at rest and liquefies under shear. It is prized for intense flavour and regional identity.",
  "Harvesting & Processing": "Super strong colonies before the heather flow. Use prickers or uncapping needles to break gel structure; press or specialist extractors may be required. Warm rooms aid flow but avoid overheating; filter gently to retain desirable colloids.",
  "Properties & Uses": "Distinct jelly-like set, dark amber colour, and high colloid content. Often marketed as a premium, region-labelled product.",
  "Market & Value": "Commands a premium with trusted provenance; small-batch bottling and storytelling matter.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Consult regional producer guidance on pressing equipment and geographical indication labelling."
