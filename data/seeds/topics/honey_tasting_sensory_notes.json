  "At-a-Glance": "Good tasting notes are clear and modest. Describe colour, aroma, texture, and finish with everyday words—‘light amber, soft citrus, herbal finish’—and avoid hype or health claims. Use clean, disposable sticks if sampling; keep water and plain crackers for palate reset. Link notes to batch codes so buyers can find a favourite again. Offer a tiny pairing card—yoghurt, toast, cheese, dressings—so jars go home with a plan. Consistent, honest descriptions build trust and repeat sales without shouting.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Shoppers decide fast and remember stories. When your notes are descriptive rather than boastful, people feel informed, not sold to. Linking notes to batch codes admits natural variation and turns it into a feature—this summer’s bramble vs last spring’s willow. A simple aroma wheel helps staff and club volunteers use the same language at stalls and talks. Clean sampling keeps the table tidy and compliant, and tiny portions reduce waste. Pairing suggestions move jars from ‘nice idea’ to breakfast table habit. Over time, your stall develops a house style: calm language, neat cards, and jars that come with context. That tone matches the craft of beekeeping—careful, seasonal, real—and it’s surprisingly effective for sales.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Taste quietly and write descriptors for colour, aroma, texture, finish.",
    "Create a small card with batch code and 1–2 pairings.",
    "If sampling, set up clean spoons/stirrers and a waste pot.",
    "Train helpers with an aroma wheel and a script.",
    "Log buyer feedback to refine next season’s cards."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Behind the stall you open a retention jar, dip a clean stick and pause. Notes go onto a small form—‘gold, medium body, hedgerow, hint of citrus, quick clean finish’. You print that onto a tiny batch card that clips to the shelf. When someone asks ‘what’s it like?’, you hand them the card and offer a single, hygienic taste. The stall stays quiet and competent, not chaotic. A simple wheel of words sits taped inside the cash box so anyone helping can say ‘light floral’ instead of ‘um, nice’. Pairings are practical: yoghurt swirl, toast, soft goat cheese, or a lemon dressing. No health claims, no hyperbole—just useful guidance. After the market you jot which batch sold fastest and what words people repeated back. Next time the card reads a little better. Over the season your notes become a tiny archive that teaches you your own terroir: which hedges made June sing, and what August tasted like in a dry year.",
