  "At-a-Glance": "A regional forage calendar answers two questions: ‘when do bees feast?’ and ‘when do they fast?’ Map bloom windows for trees, hedges and herbaceous plants in your area, then mark the gaps. Fill those with resilient, non-invasive picks—often trees and shrubs that carry nectar in poor weather (lime/tilia, ivy, cotoneaster, hebe, rosemary, winter mahonia). Pair the calendar with scale-hive weight curves and simple planting lists for members and neighbours. Aim for layered plantings (trees + shrubs + ground cover) near flight paths—not just pretty borders but season-long bee income.",

  "Why it Matters": "Strong springs and calm winters come from calories, not optimism. Many yards ride a big spring wave then hit a late-summer sag; colonies shrink just before winter bees are raised. Regional calendars make this visible. Once you see the dip, you can act: plant gap-fillers, move supers timing, or plan a brood break plus oxalic when natural flows pause. Community projects love this framing: it translates bee needs into street trees and pocket-parks that help people too (shade, stormwater, birds). Clubs can publish localised lists and partner with councils or schools—‘plant one tree that feeds bees in August’. Over seasons, these choices change the silhouette of weight curves and reduce emergency feeding. Honey character improves too when late nectar sources are diverse and reliable, not just ivy sprint finishes.",

  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Collect regional bloom data (club memory + botanic sources).",
    "Overlay with scale-hive weight curves to spot gaps.",
    "Publish a simple calendar by month with ‘hero plants’.",
    "Create plant lists: trees, shrubs, ground cover (by soil/aspect).",
    "Review annually; add community planting wins and lessons."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Calendars become powerful when they are local and lived. Start with the trees—you’ll move more nectar with a lime avenue than with a dozen pots. In spring, willows and maples set brood arcs; in early summer, bramble is the quiet backbone in many regions; late summer can sag unless parks carry dependable shrubs; autumn ivy often saves the day but isn’t guaranteed in drought. A good club calendar highlights these beats, then names plants anyone can actually obtain from local nurseries. Present the list for different spaces: balcony (thyme, lavender), tiny garden (hebe, rosemary), street verge (cotoneaster), school edge (lime or field maple). Add icons for pollen vs nectar weight to teach what feeds brood versus jars. \n\nThen bring telemetry in. If your scale hive shows a July flatline, link it to the calendar and plant towards that week. Over a couple of seasons, you’ll see the dip soften as community trees mature. Share the wins: a before/after curve and a photo of the new planting inspire members to copy. For farmers, a hedgerow plan with staggered bloom adds pollinator support without losing field function. Calendars are not wallpaper—they are plans with dates and spades. Keep them short, pretty and updated so people carry them in their pockets and actually plant.",
