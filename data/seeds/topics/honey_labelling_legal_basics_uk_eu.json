  "At-a-Glance": "Selling honey is simple when labels are right. Put the name of the food (‘Honey’), net weight in metric (e.g., 227 g / 340 g), durability date (‘Best before’), lot/batch code, your business name/address, country of origin, and any special storage advice. If it’s a specific floral/region claim, be able to substantiate it. Small producers are usually nutrition-panel exempt; allergens aren’t typical for pure honey but cross-contamination statements must be honest. Labels must be legible, indelible and visible. Keep a sample and a batch log so you can answer questions later with confidence.",

  "Why it Matters": "Compliance builds trust and keeps market days stress-free. Trading Standards care about weights, identity and traceability; customers care about clarity and provenance. A clean label and a tidy batch log protect you if a jar leaves the table with a smudge or if a customer calls with a question months later. If you add nuts, spices or infusions, you enter different territory (PPDS/prepacked for direct sale and allergens)—write a separate SOP for that range. Country-of-origin wording and floral claims need integrity: if your jars say ‘English Honey’, your records should show apiaries and dates that back it up. Finally, lot codes connect jars to days and supers; if you ever need to withdraw a batch, you’ll do it calmly in minutes, not in a panic. Good labels aren’t just legal—they’re your quiet promise of care from hive to shelf.",

  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Decide pack sizes; calibrate scales; check tare.",
    "Design labels with required fields (name, net weight, BBE, lot, address, origin).",
    "Print/apply consistently; keep labels neat and legible.",
    "Maintain a batch log (date/apiary/boxes/jar count/lot).",
    "Keep retention samples; review yearly against regs/Trading Standards advice."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Set up your bottling table like a mini production line. Jars and lids warmed, scales checked with a test weight, a clean labeller loaded, and a batch sheet on a clipboard. As you fill, place jars onto a staging tray in rows; when a row finishes, label, cap, wipe and stamp the lot code. A best-before 2 years from bottling keeps you tidy; store jars cool and dark. On labels, keep type readable and claims modest—‘Spring honey from [county]’ beats baroque stories you can’t evidence. If you run multiple apiaries or blends, use lot codes that encode date and apiary ID; your log translates codes back to humans later. \n\nMarkets and shops vary; bring a copy of your insurance, a one-page HACCP-lite (what you do to keep things clean), and a few spare labels for swaps. If you experiment with infused products, isolate processes and labels; treat them as food with ingredients and allergens, not as ‘honey with stuff’. When in doubt, call Trading Standards—officers are usually helpful when you’re proactive. Compliance is not a hurdle; it’s a handshake with the public that your jars are as honest as your bees.",
