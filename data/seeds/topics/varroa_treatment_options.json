  "At-a-Glance": "An integrated pest management (IPM) plan cycles organic acids, essential oils, biotechnical methods, and brood interruption to keep varroa below damage thresholds.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Rotating modes of action slows resistance.",
    "Treating at the right time protects winter bees and reduces virus loads.",
    "Biotechnical options reduce chemical inputs and residue risks."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Adopt a written IPM calendar aligned to local flows.",
    "Match treatment to brood status and ambient temperatures.",
    "Verify efficacy post-treatment with a quantitative test."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Pre-winter oxalic acid when broodless or near-broodless.",
    "Formic options when temperatures permit and quick knock-down is needed.",
    "Thymol formulations post-harvest during warm stable periods.",
    "Drone brood removal during build-up as part of biotechnical control."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Assess infestation via alcohol/sugar wash.",
    "2) Choose option: oxalic acid (dribble/vapor), formic (pads), thymol (gels/strips), or synthetic where permitted and necessary.",
    "3) Confirm temperature window and colony strength.",
    "4) Apply per label and manufacturer guidance exactly.",
    "5) Mark calendar for removal or follow-up.",
    "6) Re-test 10–14 days after treatment to confirm efficacy."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Winter: oxalic acid ideal when broodless.",
    "Late summer/early autumn: thymol or formic depending on weather.",
    "Spring build-up: biotechnical methods and careful timing to avoid queen loss."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Target post-treatment reduction >80 percent from baseline count.",
    "Autumn targets are stricter to protect winter bees (often <1–2 percent infestation)."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: High mites during hot spell -> Avoid formic in heat spikes -> Use thymol if within range, or plan brood break + oxalic.",
    "Symptom: Ineffective outcome -> Confirm dosage and exposure time -> Switch mode of action and retest."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Applying outside temperature range causing queen loss or poor efficacy.",
    "Failure to remove strips on time.",
    "Skipping the verification test post-treatment."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "OA vaporiser or dribble kit, PPE, timers.",
    "Formic pads, spacers, screen bottoms.",
    "Thymol gel/strips, brood trapping frames."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Follow local approvals and labels exactly.",
    "Use PPE for acids and ventilate well.",
    "Maintain residue and treatment logs."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Baseline mite count recorded.",
    "Product, lot, and expiry noted.",
    "Application start/end times logged.",
    "Post-treatment count scheduled."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain to customers why treatment timing protects honey quality and bee health."
