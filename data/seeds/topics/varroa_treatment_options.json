  "At-a-Glance": "Match treatment to brood status, temperature, and residue risk. Rotate actives to reduce resistance.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Effective control with minimal taint and resistance pressure.",
    "Protects winter bees and harvest reputation."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Keep a rotation plan across seasons.",
    "Tie each product to a clear SOP and timing window.",
    "Verify efficacy and record all batches."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Decision matrix: season × brood × temperature → option list.",
    "Pre- and post-treatment counts logged.",
    "Boxes and honey flows scheduled to avoid conflicts."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Identify window: pre/post harvest, broodless vs brood-on.",
    "2) Select active: oxalic, formic, thymol, amitraz—per label and plan.",
    "3) Prepare kit and safety gear; apply per SOP.",
    "4) Recount mites; document efficacy; rotate actives next time."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Cold broodless midwinter suits oxalic dribbles/vapor where legal.",
    "Warm late summer suits thymol/formic—respect temp limits."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Target defined efficacy (e.g., >80% reduction—method dependent).",
    "Temperature bands from labels guide go/no-go."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Low efficacy -> Reassess application; reinvasion; change active.",
    "Symptom: Bee stress -> Check temperature and ventilation; stop if unsafe.",
    "Symptom: Residue worry -> Use non-taint options outside supers; observe withdrawal."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Treating during nectar flow with tainting actives.",
    "Repeating same active each year.",
    "Poor ventilation on formic leading to queen loss."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Timers, PPE, applicators/vaporizers, spacers for ventilation.",
    "Yard checklist and treatment log."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Follow labels and local approvals strictly.",
    "PPE and ventilation especially for acids and vapours."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Counts before/after scheduled.",
    "Correct active and dose staged.",
    "Ventilation/temperature checked."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain rotation to club mates to reduce resistance pressure."
