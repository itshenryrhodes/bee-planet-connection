  "Snapshot": "Clear site agreements prevent misunderstandings and secure long-term placements; outline access, liability, hive numbers, and expectations.",
  "Supply & Demand": "Good sites near key flows are scarce; professional communication and tidy yards create demand for your presence rather than tolerance.",
  "Revenue Streams": "Some landowners accept rent in honey, others prefer cash; formalise barter values and delivery schedules. Add clauses for crop pollination or publicity where useful.",
