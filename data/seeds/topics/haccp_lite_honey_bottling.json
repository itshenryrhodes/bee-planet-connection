  "At-a-Glance": "A lightweight HACCP focuses on a few real hazards: moisture, foreign bodies, cleaning residues, and mislabelling.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Proves due diligence and keeps bottling consistent.",
    "Cuts risk without bureaucracy."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Identify hazards and critical control points (CCPs).",
    "Define monitoring and corrective actions.",
    "Keep simple records tied to batches."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "One-page plan with CCPs: moisture, filter integrity, label accuracy.",
    "Log sheets for jarring sessions with signatures.",
    "CAPA notes for any deviation."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Map process: settling → jarring → capping → labelling → boxing.",
    "2) Set CCPs: moisture check, sieve check, label proofing.",
    "3) Train helpers; run through a mock deviation scenario.",
    "4) Review plan annually and after incidents."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Cold bottling rooms increase viscosity and capping errors.",
    "Humid spells raise condensation risk in open jars."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Moisture ≤18% unless varietal exceptions; sieve intact; torque check on lids.",
    "Label fields: name, weight, lot, BBE, country, contact."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Issue: Moisture high -> Blend/dry if permitted; downgrade; hold stock.",
    "Issue: Label error -> Stop run; relabel or recall; update proof process.",
    "Issue: Foreign body -> Quarantine, filter verify, rework/recall as per risk."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Over-complicated paperwork nobody uses.",
    "No clear corrective actions.",
    "Labels proofed only on screen, not on jar."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Torque checker, moisture meter, sieve integrity checks.",
    "Pre-flight label checklist and sign-off."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Weights/measures accuracy; allergen and legal naming.",
    "Traceability for all inputs (jars, lids, labels)."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "CCPs monitored and signed.",
    "Deviations documented.",
    "Retains kept from each batch."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain CCPs to helpers—what and why."
