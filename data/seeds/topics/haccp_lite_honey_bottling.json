  "At-a-Glance": "HACCP sounds heavy; at small scale it’s just ‘what might go wrong and what do we do about it’. List simple hazards (glass, water ingress, cross-contact), add controls (jar checks, dry room, separate infused lines), and keep short records (batch sheet, clean-down tickbox). Label with lot codes and keep a sample jar. If you add ingredients, treat that as a separate flow with an allergen note. Review your sheet yearly. This light discipline makes market days calmer and answers questions without panic.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Honey is low risk but not no risk. Bottling days juggle warm jars, sticky floors, labels, and lids; misses here show up later as leakers, cloudy jars, or compliance questions. A pared-down HACCP gives you confidence: you check jars for chips, keep a dry workspace to avoid moisture creep, and separate pure honey from any infused or PPDS products. Cleaning has a start and finish, not a vague intention. Records are tiny—date, batch, jar count, any incidents—but they anchor lot codes and best-before dates to reality. If Trading Standards or a shop asks, you have a tidy packet that shows you’re careful and consistent. Most of all, your own stress drops because you know where the risks live and how you tame them.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Map the flow: warm jars → fill → lid → wipe → label → code → box.",
    "List hazards at each step and your control (visual checks, dryness, separation).",
    "Make one A4 checklist for clean-down and start-up.",
    "Record batch details and keep one sample jar per lot.",
    "Review annually; tweak controls after any incident."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Your bottling corner reads like a recipe card. Before you start, you tick clean-down: surfaces wiped, hair tied, pets out, bins lined, floor dry. Jars sit warming in a cabinet; you inspect rims as they come out and reject any chips. Honey flows from a settling tank through a coarse strainer if needed; you keep lids upside down on a clean tray. Each filled jar gets a firm lid, a wipe, and a label. You stamp a lot code that encodes date and apiary; a line on the batch sheet notes jar size, count, and any hiccups. A jug spills? It goes in the incidents box and you add ‘wiped, re-sanitised’ to the sheet. \n\nIf you make an infused line, it happens on a different day or at least after a full clean-down, with separate utensils. That batch sheet carries an allergen line if relevant. At the end, you stage boxes cool and dark, write a best-before two years out, and drop one jar into the retention shelf. The whole packet lives in a slim folder—boring, short, and exactly what you need when a shop asks for a spec or a customer emails six months later about a question on a code. This is HACCP-lite: clear thought, tiny records, big calm.",
  
  "Evidence Highlights": [
    "Visual glass checks reduce contamination and leaks.",
    "Dry bottling spaces reduce fermentation risk from moisture creep.",
    "Lot coding and retention jars enable quick, targeted recalls if needed."

  "Seasonality & Climate": "Humid spells need dehumidifiers; winter rooms need warmth for flow and clean fills.",
