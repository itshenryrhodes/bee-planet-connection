  "At-a-Glance": "Checkerboarding places drawn and undrawn comb alternately above the brood nest before swarm season to disrupt nectar backfilling and relieve congestion.",
  "Why it Matters": "Swarm impulse builds when the brood nest is compressed and foragers backfill with nectar. Providing mixed comb encourages processing without blocking brood expansion.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Before the main flow, add a super with alternating drawn and foundation frames over the brood nest. Maintain proper spacing and monitor progress weekly. Combine with timely supering and, if needed, brood nest expansion.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Apply ahead of swarming conditions in your region. In cool climates, avoid over-opening the nest; in warm zones, watch for cross-comb if space is added too quickly.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Adding too much cold space, creating cross-comb through poor levelling, or delaying additional supers once bees begin drawing."
