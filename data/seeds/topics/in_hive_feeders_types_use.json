{
  "Overview": "Different feeder designs suit different goals: rapid bulk feeding, stimulative trickle, or emergency winter placement. Choose for speed, robbing risk, temperature, and handling.",
  "Types & Variants": "Contact feeders (jar/tub with perforated lid), frame feeders inside the brood box, top feeders above the crownboard, and entrance/boardman feeders (higher robbing risk). Fondant/candy boards for cold periods.",
  "Using It Well": "Reduce robbing by feeding internally and at dusk; seal gaps; avoid spillage. In winter, fondant directly above the cluster saves lives. Clean and store feeders dry between seasons.",
  "Costs & Practicalities": "Frame and top feeders cost more but reduce robbing; contact feeders are cheap and flexible; entrance feeders are convenient but risky in dearth.",
  "Recent Innovations": "Insulated tops with integrated feeders, slow-release valve lids, and clearer sight-windows to judge fill levels without disturbance."
