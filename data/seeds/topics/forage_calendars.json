{
  "Overview": "Planning around nectar and pollen flows lets beekeepers time space, splits, and feeding with confidence.",
  "Drivers & Mechanisms": "UK flows: spring OSR and orchard bloom; main summer clover/lime/bramble; late summer heather in some regions; ivy into autumn. Mediterranean flows start earlier, with spring herbs and citrus, summer sunflowers/lavenders, and mid-summer dearths in hot/dry areas.",
  "Impacts & Case Studies": "Mismatches between hive strength and flows cost honey and stress colonies. Align supering and swarm control with local calendars.",
  "Mitigation & Best Practice": "Use local bloom diaries, plant staggered forage, and avoid harvesting suspect nectars (e.g., toxic rhododendron). Feed only to bridge genuine gaps, not during good flows."
