{
  "Overview": "Most exposure risks are preventable with timing, drift control, and clear agreements with growers.",
  "Drivers & Mechanisms": "Sprays during bee flight, dusty formulations, and microencapsulated actives increase risk. Drift from aerial/high-pressure applications extends impact beyond target fields.",
  "Impacts & Case Studies": "Acute kills may be obvious, but sublethal effects (navigation, queen quality) also impair performance. Beekeepers in pollination contracts face concentrated risk windows.",
  "Mitigation & Best Practice": "Agree notice windows with growers; avoid spraying during bloom and flight (choose late evening/night). Prefer ground sprays with coarse droplets; avoid dusts where possible. Keep hive placements away from drift lines; document dates and observations.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Add regional codes of practice and contract templates; include insurer guidance for incident response."
