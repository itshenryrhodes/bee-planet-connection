  "Overview": "Designing landscapes for continuous bloom supports honey bees and wild pollinators, improving biodiversity and crop outcomes.",
  "Drivers & Mechanisms": "Staggered flowering reduces dearths; better spray timing prevents harm; nesting habitat and water complete the picture.",
  "Impacts & Case Studies": "Urban verges, farm flower strips, and mixed hedgerows increase pollinator abundance and can lift fruit set and seed quality.",
  "Mitigation & Best Practice": "Plan seasonal palettes (early willow/fruit; mid clovers/lavenders; late ivy/sedum). Prefer local natives; reduce mowing; provide water and nesting sites; coordinate with neighbours and councils.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Use recognised pollinator plant lists and local extension guidance to tailor mixes.",
  "Notes": "",
  "At-a-Glance": "One-sentence overview pending."
