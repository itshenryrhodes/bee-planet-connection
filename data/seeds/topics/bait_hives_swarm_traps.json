  "At-a-Glance": "Well-placed bait hives intercept local swarms and reduce nuisance calls. The recipe is simple: the right volume, used-comb scent, and sensible siting.",
  "Why it Matters": "Catching primary swarms early preserves local genetics and provides low-cost increase.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Use ~40L boxes with a small entrance. Add one old dark brood frame for scent and the rest foundation or starter strips. Place 3â€“5 m high in shade/partial sun, facing south-east if possible. Use a small amount of lure or lemongrass oil. Inspect weekly and relocate caught swarms at dusk.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Prime late spring/early summer; earlier in warm regions. After season, remove or sanitise equipment to deter pests.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Too large/small volume, open entrances inviting robbing, or placing boxes in unsafe retrieval spots.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Sturdy boxes, old comb, straps, safe access gear, lures, transport containers."
