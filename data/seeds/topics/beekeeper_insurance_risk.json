  "Snapshot": "Formalising risk management protects livelihoods and relationships with landowners and clients. Insurance complements good records and safe practice.",
  "Supply & Demand": "Insurers and growers increasingly expect documented hive strength, biosecurity, and incident proceduresâ€”especially for pollination work or public-facing apiaries.",
  "Revenue Streams": "Policies often bundle public liability, product liability (honey/bee products), tools/equipment cover, and business interruption. Some include specific extensions for pollination contracts or livestock losses.",
  "Risks & Compliance": "Maintain inspection/treatment logs, movement records, and contracts with clear responsibilities (e.g., no-spray clauses). In the event of pesticide incidents or stings to the public, contemporaneous notes and photographs materially aid claims and defence.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Review association schemes and commercial policies; align documentation (site permissions, hazard assessments) with insurer and client requirements."
