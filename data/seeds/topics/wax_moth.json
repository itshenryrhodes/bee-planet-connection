  "At-a-Glance": "Wax moths destroy stored comb and exploit weak colonies. The fix is proactive hygiene and smart storage.",
  "Why it Matters": "Drawn comb is a valuable asset; losing it sets colonies back and increases management workload.",
  "Step-by-Step": "1) Keep colonies strong; unite weak units before autumn. 2) Retire old blackened combs; scrape burr/propolis where moths hide. 3) For storage: freeze frames to kill eggs/larvae, then store cool, bright, and ventilated. 4) Inspect stores periodically; respond early to any webbing.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "In cooler climates, winter chill helps; in warm climates use freezing/heat treatment and airflow to deter infestations year-round.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Dark, stagnant sheds invite moths; sealed stacks without prep let larvae flourish; leaving excessive empty comb on colonies late season attracts invasion.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Freezer or controlled heat, breathable storage, occasional pheromone/sticky monitoring traps; optional biological/approved chemical protectants where legal.",
  "Notes": ""
