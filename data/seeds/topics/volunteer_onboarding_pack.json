  "At-a-Glance": "New helpers thrive with clear roles and a warm briefing. Share a one-page pack: who you are, what volunteers do, where to meet, what to wear, who to call, and a short code of conduct. Add a 10 minute safety talk (lifting, stings, tools) and pair rookies with a buddy. Keep contact cards and a simple rota. Thank people often and rotate tasks so skills grow. Onboarding is hospitality plus safety—done well, volunteers stick around and events run smoothly.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Clubs depend on goodwill. Without structure, volunteers feel lost or get hurt; with a light plan, they feel trusted and useful. A short pack prevents avoidable friction: what to bring, how we speak to the public, when to step back if unwell, and who handles money or media. A buddy system reduces accidents and builds confidence; a contact tree speeds decisions when plans change. Safeguarding and conduct notes protect everyone at family events. Rotas spread load and prevent burnout. Celebrating contributions—names in a newsletter, a jar now and then—keeps the circle strong. The tone stays bright and breezy: simple rules, kind leadership, and small wins.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Write a one-page pack: roles, safety, contacts, timings, dress.",
    "Run a quick briefing at the start of each session; assign buddies.",
    "Use a simple rota and contact tree; share via email or chat.",
    "Capture feedback; rotate roles; thank publicly and privately.",
    "Review the pack each season; update lessons learned."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Saturday at the club apiary: volunteers gather, you tick names on a laminated sheet, and run a 10 minute chat—today’s jobs, PPE, lifting and smoker safety, public liaison. Each new helper pairs with a steady hand. A contact card lists the lead’s mobile and urgent numbers. Tasks rotate—one on tools, one greeting visitors, one on records. At the end you debrief: what was tricky, what to change, who’s free next week. A photo (with consent) and a thank you hits the newsletter. People come back because the work feels safe, clear and appreciated.",
  
  "Evidence Highlights": [
    "Buddy systems reduce accidents and improve retention.",
    "Short, repeated safety briefings outperform long manuals.",
    "Clear roles lower stress and increase event quality."
