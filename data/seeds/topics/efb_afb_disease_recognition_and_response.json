  "At-a-Glance": "European Foulbrood (EFB) and American Foulbrood (AFB) are notifiable brood diseases. Early recognition, strict biosecurity, and immediate reporting prevent spread and heavy losses.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "AFB spores persist for decades and can devastate apiaries if moved on contaminated kit.",
    "EFB can smoulder, reducing colony performance and drifting across a yard.",
    "Legal obligations apply: rapid, correct reporting protects the wider beekeeping community."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Train the eye for classic signs; confirm suspicions without spreading material.",
    "Quarantine suspect colonies and equipment immediately.",
    "Follow official inspector guidance step-by-step, documenting actions."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Regular brood inspections that include slow, careful frame scanning in good light.",
    "Isolating tools/boxes used on suspect hives; no frame swapping.",
    "Clear photos (where permitted) and prompt contact with the competent authority."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Recognise signs: EFB often shows twisted larvae, melted appearance, and irregular brood patterns; AFB shows sunken perforated cappings, ropy larval remains, black scale.",
    "2) Do not leak material: keep frames over the hive; avoid shaking or dropping comb.",
    "3) Isolate: close up the colony; mark hive; do not visit other colonies with the same tools.",
    "4) Report: contact the official inspector line per your country; provide location, photos, and notes.",
    "5) Follow instructions: sampling, standstill orders, shook swarm or destruction protocols vary by jurisdiction.",
    "6) Decontaminate: flame-clean metal tools; dispose of contaminated materials per instruction; update biosecurity plan.",
    "7) Traceback: review movement of frames, nucs, and used kit; inform any contacts."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "EFB often detected in spring/early summer during build-up.",
    "Stress (nutrition, weather) can exacerbate disease expression."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "These are notifiable diseases — threshold for action is suspicion, not certainty.",
    "Maintain a log with dates, colony IDs, photos, inspector references and outcomes."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Patchy brood with twisted larvae -> Suspect EFB -> Stop frame transfers -> Report.",
    "Symptom: Sunken perforated cappings and ropey test -> Suspect AFB -> Seal hive -> Report immediately.",
    "Symptom: Recurrent brood issues post-treatment -> Reassess nutrition, varroa, and hygiene -> Seek inspector advice."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Moving suspect frames to ‘test’ in another colony.",
    "Cleaning with ineffective methods; spores survive casual washing.",
    "Delaying notification while crowdsourcing opinions."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Bright LED headlamp, clean disposable gloves, sealable bags for samples (as instructed).",
    "Flame gun for metal tools where safe; dedicated quarantine box.",
    "Disinfectants approved for apiary use (follow label)."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Comply with legal reporting and movement restrictions.",
    "Respect inspector directions; document chain of custody for samples."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Suspect frames photographed (if allowed) without shaking.",
    "Hive marked and isolated; tools quarantined.",
    "Inspector contact made; reference noted."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Inform landowners discreetly that a health check is underway; avoid speculation."
