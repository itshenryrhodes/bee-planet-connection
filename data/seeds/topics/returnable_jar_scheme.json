  "At-a-Glance": "A simple, hygienic jar-return program saves costs and waste—if you control washing standards and label removal.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Lower packaging costs and environmental footprint.",
    "Engages customers and shops with a clear incentive."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Define which jars you accept and the return credit.",
    "Set up washing/inspection that meets food safety.",
    "Track returns and re-use cycles."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Only your SKUs accepted; lids discarded; jars pre-washed by customers.",
    "Commercial wash or validated SOP; visual and sniff test before reuse.",
    "Return credits tracked; stock rotated by cycles."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Publish rules: accepted jars, clean-only, no lids, credit value.",
    "2) Set wash SOP: soak, de-label, wash-rinse-sanitise, dry, inspect.",
    "3) Mark reused jars batch-wise; keep records.",
    "4) Train staff/shops on handling and credits."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Cold slows drying; warm seasons need faster turnover to avoid odours.",
    "Holiday spikes increase returns—plan capacity."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Reject rate target and reasons logged.",
    "Cap number of reuse cycles if glass quality degrades."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Issue: Residual odours -> Extend soak; change detergent; reject if persistent.",
    "Issue: Label glue -> Adjust solvent/temperature; switch label stock.",
    "Issue: Confusion at tills -> Clear signage; barcode the credit."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Accepting non-standard jars.",
    "Reusing compromised or chipped glass.",
    "Poor drying causing mouldy odours."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Soak tanks, scrapers, label-removal solvent, drying racks.",
    "Credit tracking via POS codes."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Food contact hygiene validated; reject damaged jars.",
    "Clear disclaimer about lids—always new food-safe lids."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Rules printed for markets/shops.",
    "Wash log started.",
    "Reject bin labelled."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Frame as ‘reduce waste, save £’ with clear credit."
