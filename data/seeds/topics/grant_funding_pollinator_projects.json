  "At-a-Glance": "Funding follows clarity. Pick one focused project—trees for gap weeks, school bee garden, or community training—and write a short case: the need, what you will do, who benefits, the budget, and how you will measure success. Get two quotes for large items, list volunteer match hours, and set a tidy timeline. Use plain language and a one page budget. Report back with photos, a short note on outcomes vs plan, and a spend summary. Repeatable, small wins beat giant, vague proposals.",
  
  "Why it Matters": "Grants can accelerate planting or education, but they can also sap time if unfocused. Funders look for achievable scope, community benefit, and credible delivery. A simple structure helps: a one sentence need, a bullet list of activities, a short budget with quotes, and outcomes that can be checked (trees planted, pupils trained, nectar gap reduced). Match funding in the form of volunteer hours shows buy-in. Reporting is as important as applying—clear before and after photos, a map, and a line on lessons learned build a track record that makes the next bid easier. Keeping paperwork consistent across bids reduces friction and lets you get outside to plant rather than chase attachments.",
  
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Define the need and beneficiaries; pick a focused project scope.",
    "Draft outcomes and a simple method; gather 2 quotes if needed.",
    "Build a one page budget with any match and a realistic timeline.",
    "Submit with plain language and one photo or diagram.",
    "Deliver and report with photos, counts, and a short lessons section."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Your club spots a late summer nectar gap. You propose 10 small trees for a school and a park verge, plus a workshop for families. The bid states the need in one line, then lists actions: site permissions, plant purchase, planting days, and a follow up watering rota. The budget fits on one page with tree costs, guards, mulch, signage, and volunteer time logged as match. Outcomes are concrete: 10 trees planted, 2 workshops, 40 attendees, and a photo map of locations. You include a simple timeline from February permissions to April planting and a September review. Once funded, you run planting days, take tidy photos, and share a brief, honest report: what worked, what changed, and who helped. Next winter you apply again with confidence because you have a model and evidence that you deliver.",
