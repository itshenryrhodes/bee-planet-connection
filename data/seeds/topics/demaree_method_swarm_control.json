{
  "At-a-Glance": "The Demaree method reduces swarming by separating the queen from most brood while maintaining a strong foraging force in one stack.",
  "Why it Matters": "Unlike simple splits, Demaree retains nectar-gathering strength for the main flow while removing the triggers that drive swarm impulse.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Place the queen with one frame of emerging brood and eggs in the bottom box with foundation/space; put remaining brood in an upper box separated by a queen excluder (and often a super). Ensure ample space above for brood to emerge and for nectar processing. Break down any queen cells in the upper box after 7â€“10 days; repeat checks as needed.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Apply ahead of or at first signs of congestion/swarm cells in spring build-up; adapt timings to local flows.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Leaving viable queen cells in the upper box; failing to provide space; not confirming queen location before rearrangement.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Queen excluder, extra brood boxes/supers, spare frames/foundation, clear marking of queen box, and a calendar for follow-up checks."
