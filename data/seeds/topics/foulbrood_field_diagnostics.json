  "Overview": "Rapid, defensible diagnosis of American and European foulbrood protects apiaries and speeds engagement with authorities where required.",
  "Biology & Transmission": "AFB spores persist on wood and comb for decades; EFB thrives in stressed colonies. Both spread via contaminated honey/frames, robbing, and beekeeper tools.",
  "Symptoms & Field Diagnosis": "Use a structured checklist: cappings (sunken/perforated), larval appearance, smell, ‘rope’ test for AFB, and distribution (pre- or post-capping). Where available, deploy validated lateral-flow or lab tests on suspect samples. Photograph frames and record coordinates.",
  "Impact on Colony": "Both diseases depress brood replacement; AFB is usually terminal without eradication. EFB can wax and wane with management but still harms productivity.",
  "Control & Treatment": "Follow jurisdictional rules. AFB typically mandates destruction and sterilisation; EFB management may include shook swarm, improved nutrition, and supervised treatments. Quarantine equipment and halt frame exchanges until cleared.",
  "Prevention & Good Practice": "Hygiene on tools, no swapping suspect comb, and disciplined record-keeping. Train your eye with image libraries and official guides."
