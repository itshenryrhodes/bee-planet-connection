  "At-a-Glance": "Keep online simple: a small catalogue, clean photos, plain words, and clear delivery zones. Price shipping realistically—flat rates or weight bands—and choose packaging that survives couriers (double wall boxes, jar dividers). Publish a short, human returns/breakage policy and an FAQ that covers crystallisation and storage. Offer one or two dispatch days per week so packing is organised. Email customers with tracking and a care note. Start tidy, learn your true costs, and only add complexity when the basics hum.",

  "Why it Matters": "Selling online adds friction where markets are easy—shipping, breakage, returns and admin. A small, disciplined setup avoids the common traps: underpriced postage that eats margin, flimsy boxes that multiply refunds, and vague policies that scare buyers. Fewer SKUs keep picking accurate; scheduled dispatch days reduce constant context switching. Clear photos and copy reduce customer service churn. A visible care note and an honest crystallisation line set expectations and cut ‘faulty product’ claims. Over time, you’ll learn real parcel rates, best couriers for your area, and the box/insert combos that just never break. The aim isn’t to become a warehouse—it’s to extend your stall online without losing your weekend to tape and spreadsheets.",

  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Choose a simple storefront platform and payments.",
    "Limit SKUs; photograph cleanly; write clear copy and FAQs.",
    "Set shipping zones and flat or banded rates that cover real cost.",
    "Pick robust packaging; test mail to yourself; refine.",
    "Publish returns/breakage policy; schedule dispatch days; automate emails."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "Imagine your site like your best stall: two pages, tidy photos, and prices that make sense. Product pages show jar size, batch style (runny/set), a one sentence flavour line, and storage advice. The basket calculates shipping with a flat rate that actually covers your cheapest reliable courier. Packing happens on Tuesdays and Fridays only; labels print in a batch, boxes are pre-built, and inserts match your jar sizes exactly. Each order prints with a short checklist: jars counted, lids checked, story card included, tape seams pressed. When the first box breaks in the wild, you update the insert once, not ten times. A ‘crystallisation is natural’ note lives on every product and in the order email, alongside a warm thanks and tracking link. Returns are rare because you set expectations and used sturdy boxes. As orders grow, you tweak: a second box size, a better rate you negotiated, and a macro that prints labels and emails in one go. You stayed small on purpose, and the online shop now feels like a calm extension of your table, not a chaos machine.",
