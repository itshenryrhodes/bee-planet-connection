  "At-a-Glance": "Safe collection, disease check, and structured aftercare turn swarms into productive colonies with minimal risk to the apiary.",
  "Why it Matters": "New swarms can carry disease or queen issues. A consistent protocol reduces surprises and protects existing stock.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Assess access and safety; collect calmly into ventilated box; place onto frames in a prepared hive with feed if light on stores. After settling, inspect for queen/rightness and brood. Monitor varroa and treat if necessary. Mark/record origin where known.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Prime swarms in spring build fastest; late swarms may need feeding and careful overwintering plans.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Skipping health checks, placing swarms too close to busy paths, or failing to secure boxes during transport.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Swarm sheet, ventilated box, nuc/hive with frames, feeder, straps, PPE, records.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Local association best-practice and public safety guidance for swarm calls."
