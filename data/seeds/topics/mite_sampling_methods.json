{
  "At-a-Glance": "Consistent, quantitative mite sampling beats guesswork. Alcohol washes are the reference standard; sugar rolls and CO₂ give alternatives with different trade-offs.",
  "Why it Matters": "Threshold-based actions prevent over- or under-treating. Comparable results across yards let you evaluate treatment efficacy and resistance risk.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Sample ~300 bees from the brood nest. Alcohol wash: submerge and agitate; count mites vs bees. Sugar roll: dust, roll, and shake out; return live bees. CO₂: anesthetise briefly and separate mites. Record % infestation and repeat at set calendar points.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Sample in spring build-up, post-spring flow, post-harvest, and pre-winter. In continuous-brood climates, add mid-season checks.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Sampling foragers instead of nurse bees, too few bees, inconsistent shaking times, and comparing different methods without conversion.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Marked sampling jar/cup, alcohol or powdered sugar/CO₂ kit, scoop for counts, notebook or digital logs."
