  "Overview": "Well-chosen trees and shrubs provide high-impact nectar and pollen across seasons with minimal upkeepâ€”ideal for farms, estates, and urban corridors.",
  "Drivers & Mechanisms": "Stagger bloom for continuity: early (willow, hazel, mahonia), mid (hawthorn, apple/pear/plum, lime), late (ivy, heather on suitable soils, sweet chestnut). Mix natives with proven ornamentals where appropriate.",
  "Impacts & Case Studies": "Hedgerow restoration and street-tree schemes boost forage diversity, reduce dearths, and support wild pollinators alongside honey bees.",
  "Mitigation & Best Practice": "Match species to soil and exposure; avoid invasive taxa; plan for drought tolerance; coordinate with councils or landowners for long-term maintenance. Plant in blocks/lines to aid bee orientation.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Consult reputable UK pollinator plant lists and forestry guidance for species selection and establishment."
