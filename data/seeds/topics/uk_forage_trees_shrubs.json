  "At-a-Glance": "Trees and shrubs feed colonies at scale. Champion staggered species from willow to ivy with local provenance where possible.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "High-nectar canopies beat small beds for yield.",
    "Supports wild pollinators alongside honey bees."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Create a seasonal tree/shrub plan per yard radius.",
    "Favour natives or well-behaved non-natives with long bloom.",
    "Work with councils, farms, and schools."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Willow, maple, fruit trees, chestnut/lime, and ivy staggered.",
    "Hedgerows with hawthorn/blackthorn/field maple/rose.",
    "Mix of nectar and pollen sources; signage and care plan."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Map current canopy and gaps; talk to landowners.",
    "2) Choose species for soil/aspect; order bare-root in winter.",
    "3) Plant with guards/mulch; water 2 summers; record survival.",
    "4) Replace failures; update outreach boards."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Winter planting best; drought summers need watering.",
    "Storms require stakes/guards checks."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Tree survival % year 1/2; bloom onset notes.",
    "Hedgerow length added and species diversity."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Poor survival -> Wrong species/soil; improve mulch/water.",
    "Vandalism -> Involve local groups; add cages/signs.",
    "No bloom -> Age/time; pick some faster bloomers nearby."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Plant-and-forget.",
    "Copying lists without local soils/PH consideration.",
    "Monoculture hedges."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Bare-root whips, mulch, guards/stakes, watering rota.",
    "Simple GIS map of plantings."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Utility checks before digging.",
    "Native/invasive species rules."

  "Field Checklist": [
    "Planting plan and permissions.",
    "Guards/labels ready.",
    "Watering rota active."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Show before/after photos; thank partners annually."
