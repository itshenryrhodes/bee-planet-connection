{
  "Overview": "Simple GIS layers (land cover, hedgerows, crop maps) combined with bloom calendars reveal forage gaps and guide optimal apiary placements and flight-line planning.",
  "Drivers & Mechanisms": "Landscape configuration—field size, edge density, and habitat patches—drives nectar continuity. Proximity to water and shelter influences flight efficiency and brood thermoregulation.",
  "Impacts & Case Studies": "Farms adding wildflower margins at field edges saw improved pollinator abundance and fruit set; urban projects used tree inventories to plan staggered bloom in street corridors.",
  "Mitigation & Best Practice": "Map within a 2–3 km radius; prioritise mixed habitats; avoid pesticide drift lines; coordinate with landowners to establish stepping-stone plantings. Reassess annually with crop rotations.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Use open land-cover datasets, local crop maps, and pollinator plant lists; store shapefiles with your apiary records for repeatable planning."
