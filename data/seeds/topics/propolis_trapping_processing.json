  "What It Is": "Propolis is a resinous mixture collected from plant buds and used by bees to seal and sanitise cavities; beekeepers can harvest it ethically with mesh traps.",

  "Further Reading & Sources": "Consult food/cosmetic guidance for solvent grades, maximum residue considerations, and labelling.",
