  "At-a-Glance": "Pre-emptive requeening preserves performance; reactive requeening rescues colonies showing poor brood patterns or temper. Match method and timing to nectar flows and population.",
  "Why it Matters": "Strong queens set colony trajectory for months. Waiting until failure risks lost flows and defensive behaviour that is harder to correct.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Pre-emptive: replace 1â€“2 year queens after main flow; introduce a caged, mated queen with candy release. Reactive: verify queenlessness or failure, add open brood to stabilise pheromones, then use a push-in cage over emerging brood for safer acceptance. Log performance pre/post.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Acceptance improves during steady flows and mild weather. Avoid cold snaps and deep dearths where possible.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Introducing into queen-right colonies, skipping test frames, and pulling the cage before workers settle.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Marked queens, introduction cages, test frames, timing chart, and calm handling routine."
