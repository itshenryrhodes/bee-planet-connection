{
  "At-a-Glance": "Feed only when necessary: thin syrup (1:1) to stimulate spring build-up, thick syrup (2:1) or fondant to prevent starvation in autumn/winter, protein patties when pollen is genuinely scarce and brood rearing is desired.",
  "Why it Matters": "Sugar is not a perfect substitute for nectar and pollen; misuse drives poor comb use or ill-timed brood rearing.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Assess stores and natural flows first. Use internal feeders to reduce robbing. Stop stimulative feeding ahead of winter bee rearing; avoid unknown/contaminated honey.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Over-feeding during strong flows, relying on HFCS of uncertain quality, or feeding protein when colonies are broodless.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Reliable feeders, refractometer for honey moisture checks, accurate scales/logs for tracking consumption."
