  "At-a-Glance": "Match overwintering to climate: stay warm and dry in deep cold; manage moisture in mild/wet zones; ensure adequate stores everywhere.",
  "Why it Matters": "Winter survival hinges on healthy winter bees, low mite loads, dry interiors, and sufficient food. Mistakes here echo into spring build-up.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Maritime: prioritise moisture control (vented floors, quilt/moisture boards), check stores frequently. Continental/alpine: add insulation/windbreaks, reduce entrances, ensure ample stores and rodent guards. All zones: low Varroa before winter, stable equipment, accessible fondant/candy if needed.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Cluster forms around ~10°C; prolonged brood breaks aid oxalic acid timing. Sudden warm spells prompt early brood—adjust feed and ventilation accordingly.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Over-insulation without venting (mould), under-feeding, and late Varroa treatments that leave winter bees compromised.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Moisture boards/quilt boxes, insulation wraps where appropriate, fondant/candy boards, reliable stands and straps."
