{
  "Overview": "Brood volume drives swarm pressure and spring build-up. Single brood simplifies inspections; double brood adds space and flexibility; brood-and-a-half mixes depths but complicates interchangeability.",
  "Types & Variants": "Nationals commonly use single or brood-and-a-half (deep + shallow); Langstroths often run single or double deeps; poly variants alter insulation and weight. Standardising frame sizes streamlines management.",
  "Using It Well": "Match configuration to strain, flows, and your lifting limits. Provide space ahead of the main nectar flow and keep brood contiguous. In mixed-depth systems, manage where brood sits to avoid awkward frame moves.",
  "Costs & Practicalities": "Double brood increases equipment and weight; brood-and-a-half introduces complexity in spares; singles risk congestion without timely supering.",
  "Recent Innovations": "Lightweight poly broods and insulated covers help spring build-up; brood nest thermals can be monitored with low-cost sensors to inform sizing decisions."
