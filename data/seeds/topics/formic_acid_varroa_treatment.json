  "At-a-Glance": "Formic acid products can reduce varroa even with sealed brood present, reaching mites under cappings. Success hinges on temperature windows, ventilation, and strict label compliance.",
  "Why it Matters": "Where brood is continuous, formic provides a tool to lower mite loads before winter bees are reared—often the difference between survival and spring collapse.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Check ambient temperature is within the product’s specified range. Remove supers if required. Space frames for airflow; place pads according to label. Monitor colony behaviour during the first hours. Recount mites after the full course and record batch/expiry and dates.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Best in late summer/early autumn post-harvest or in spring before main flows, within the product’s temperature band. Heat waves and cold snaps reduce safety/efficacy—reschedule rather than risk the queen.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Treating outside temperature limits, poor ventilation, stacking strong odour treatments back-to-back, and failing to verify efficacy with post-treatment counts.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Approved formic product, thermometer/data logger, mite sampling kit, spare spacers, and a logbook."
