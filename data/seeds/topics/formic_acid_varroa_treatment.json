  "At-a-Glance": "Formic acid can reach mites under cappings. Use temperature windows and ventilation rules to protect queens and brood.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Potential to reduce mites in brood.",
    "Useful when brood cannot be interrupted."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Choose product/format with clear temp limits.",
    "Ventilate and space supers/boxes correctly.",
    "Monitor queens and brood during use."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Applied within labelled temperature range.",
    "Entrance open per instructions; extra space if required.",
    "Queen present post-treatment; drop verified."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Check forecast; confirm temp/humidity fit the label.",
    "2) Place pads/strips as directed; ensure ventilation.",
    "3) Monitor in first 24â€“48 hours; spot-check brood/queen.",
    "4) Verify mite reduction; record batch and lot."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Heat waves increase risk of queen loss; avoid.",
    "Cool spells reduce efficacy."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Label temperature and duration limits.",
    "Expected reduction range and verification plan."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Queen loss -> Stop; requeen; review timing/ventilation.",
    "Low effect -> Outside temp band; consider alternate."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Using in hot weather.",
    "Blocking entrances during treatment.",
    "Stacking multiple products without plan."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Formic pads/strips, spacer rims, temp logs.",
    "Sampling kit before/after."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Acid handling and storage safety.",
    "Follow label restrictions and withhold periods."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Weather checked; temp band OK.",
    "Ventilation set per label.",
    "Verification sampling scheduled."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain to helpers why timing and airflow matter."
