  "At-a-Glance": "Mice enter hives in autumn for warmth and food, damaging comb and contaminating stores. Simple exclusion and tidy yards prevent most incidents.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Chewed comb and urine contamination delay spring build-up.",
    "Disturbed clusters burn more stores and risk starvation.",
    "Strong odours attract more vermin and predators."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Fit mouseguards before first cold snaps.",
    "Remove ground cover that shelters rodents near stands.",
    "React quickly to signs to limit damage."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Mouseguards secured across entrances with the right aperture.",
    "Stands at 30â€“40 cm to reduce easy access and damp.",
    "No spilled feed or wax on the ground around hives."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Pre-autumn check: fit mouseguards, reduce entrances, verify fit on uneven boxes.",
    "2) Site hygiene: clear long grass, stacked junk, and food waste near stands.",
    "3) Monitoring: look for droppings, shredded wax, or nesting material at entrances.",
    "4) If ingress suspected: open on a warm day, remove nest, replace damaged frames, re-secure guard.",
    "5) For persistent pressure: consider traps outside the apiary perimeter per local law."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Risk rises with first cold spells and food scarcity.",
    "Mild winters can still see intermittent intrusions."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Any nest sign triggers immediate cleanup and guard verification.",
    "Repeated chew marks indicate poor fit or oversized apertures."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Chewed corner frames -> Replace worst, fit guards properly -> Raise stand height.",
    "Symptom: Cluster disturbed and nervous -> Check for nesting and drafts -> Improve insulation and guard.",
    "Symptom: Recurrence -> Move yard materials and use perimeter traps as permitted."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Fitting guards after the first cold snap when mice already moved in.",
    "Large apertures that admit small rodents.",
    "Leaving spilled feed or wax cappings around."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Mouseguards, entrance reducers, wire cutters, spare frames.",
    "Stand risers, tidy ground cover, sealed waste tubs."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Handle droppings with gloves and masks where appropriate.",
    "Follow local rules on trapping and baiting."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Guards fitted and checked.",
    "Stands at correct height and stable.",
    "No food waste on ground.",
    "Spare frames available."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain to site owners why grass trimming and waste control matter."
