  "At-a-Glance": "Shops buy reliability. Offer a neat price list with RRP and wholesale per case, clear MOQs, lead-times and delivery days. Case packs are sturdy, barcode the unit and, if required, the case. Labels must be compliant and legible. Provide a short sell sheet: product notes, awards if any, allergen status, and contact details. Deliver on schedule with tidy invoices. Keep flavours and sizes simple; avoid custom one-offs that destroy margin. Make reordering easy—email template, QR, or portal.",

  "Why it Matters": "Wholesale trades lower margin for volume and predictability. Stores need products that arrive on time, scan smoothly, and don’t create shelf mess. A clear, consistent offer wins buyers quickly: standard case sizes, reliable lead-times, and paperwork that matches what’s in the box. Barcodes and batch codes reduce staff friction and make recalls, if ever needed, clean. Simplicity protects your time: one or two sizes, steady RRPs, and a single delivery day for a patch of customers. Your aim isn’t to undercut yourself online; it’s to set a fair structure where everyone wins and you can actually keep up. With a calm wholesale rhythm, the extra volume funds better kit and a less stressful season.",

  "Step-by-Step": [
    "Build a price list with RRP, wholesale, MOQs, lead-time and terms.",
    "Choose case sizes and shelf-ready packaging; test barcode scans.",
    "Create a one-page sell sheet with product details and compliance notes.",
    "Schedule delivery days; standardise invoicing and batch coding.",
    "Make reorders easy; review terms annually."
  ],

  "Context & Narrative": "You email a buyer a single PDF: your logo, two SKUs, RRPs and wholesale per case, minimums, and a clear lead-time. Photos show tidy jars with legible labels and barcodes. The case opens into a mini display with a small card that carries batch and best-before for staff. When the order lands, you print an invoice, pack the case with dividers, and add a delivery note that mirrors the invoice. The drop is quick because everything matches: labels scan, jars are clean, and you arrive on the day you promised. A QR code on the case links to reorders and product specs. At season’s end you review: which shops reorder, any returns, and whether your terms held up. You might nudge MOQs or delivery windows, but the structure stands—predictable, tidy, sustainable for both sides.",
