  "At-a-Glance": "Use warm, dry air across large surface area to bring borderline moisture down before jarring—without cooking aroma.",
  "Why it Matters": [
    "Prevents fermentation and returns.",
    "Protects delicate varietal notes."
  ],
  "Objectives": [
    "Measure moisture per batch; decide blend, dry, or hold.",
    "Use ripeners/settling tanks responsibly (gentle warmth, dry air).",
    "Document pre/post moisture and actions."
  ],
  "What Good Looks Like": [
    "Dehumidified room ~25–30 °C with gentle airflow; tanks with large surface area.",
    "Short cycles; aroma intact; moisture verified before jar.",
    "No open buckets in humid rooms."
  ],
  "Step-by-Step": [
    "1) Test lots; segregate by moisture.",
    "2) Warm room/tank gently; run dehumidifier; stir minimally.",
    "3) Retest; record; decide jar, blend, or re-run.",
    "4) Keep lids on when moving; avoid condensation."
  ],
  "Seasonality & Climate": [
    "Humid harvests need more drying capacity.",
    "Winter air is dry—use it with mild warmth."
  ],
  "Data & Thresholds": [
    "Target ≤18%; never exceed temperatures that alter aroma (~<40 °C honey temp).",
    "Record start/finish moisture and time."
  ],
  "Diagnostics & Decision Tree": [
    "Symptom: Aroma loss -> Lower temps; shorten cycle; improve room RH.",
    "Symptom: Uneven readings -> Stir gently and retest.",
    "Symptom: Foam -> Skim; reduce agitation."
  ],
  "Common Pitfalls": [
    "Blasting heat; creating HMF and aroma loss.",
    "Trying to dry in a humid, unconditioned room."
  ],
  "Tools & Techniques": [
    "Refractometer, dehumidifier, warm room, ripener/settling tank with taps.",
    "Data loggers for RH/temp."
  ],
  "Safety & Compliance": [
    "Electrical safety around warm rooms/dehumidifiers.",
    "Accurate records to justify process."
  ],
  "Field Checklist": [
    "Room RH/temp in range.",
    "Start/finish readings logged.",
    "Aroma check passed."
  ],
  "Communications": [
    "Short hyphens only.",
    "Explain to staff: ‘dry air, not hot honey’."
