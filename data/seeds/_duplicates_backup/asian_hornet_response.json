  "At-a-Glance": "The yellow-legged (Asian) hornet, Vespa velutina, predates honey bees at hive entrances and can rapidly destabilise apiaries. Early detection, correct identification, and swift reporting are the priorities; nest destruction is a specialist task.",
  "Why it Matters": "Unchecked, Asian hornets reduce foraging, stress colonies, and cause significant pollinator losses. Because single nests can produce large numbers of queens, delays multiply future outbreaks. Coordinated, evidence-led response is the difference between isolated incursions and establishment.",
  "Step-by-Step": "1) Confirm ID using official guides/apps (colour, yellow legs, orange band; not the native European hornet). 2) Photograph/video at a safe distance; record time/place. 3) Report immediately via the official channel/app; follow any instructions on baiting or monitoring. 4) Reduce hive stress (robbing screens, strong units, minimal open feed). 5) Do not attempt nest destruction yourself—await trained teams to track and neutralise nests.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Spring queens are the critical window: intercepting them prevents nests maturing to produce new queens in late summer/autumn. Warm, dry seasons can amplify spread; expect more hawking behaviour around hive entrances during strong nectar flows.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Self-treating or disturbing nests, misidentifying native species, and broadcasting unverified trap designs that harm non-target insects. Ad hoc trapping without evidence can backfire—use targeted monitoring recommended by authorities.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Accredited ID resources/apps, simple monitoring stations (transparent tubs, protein/sugar baits if instructed), robbing screens, entrance reducers, and personal protective equipment. Keep a camera ready for documentation.",
  "Further Reading & Sources": "Use national reporting apps and official NBU/competent-authority pages for current procedures; see research on AI early-warning systems and official hornet response guidance."
