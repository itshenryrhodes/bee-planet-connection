  "At-a-Glance": "Clean kit, sensible movements, and record-keeping prevent disease spread.",
  "Why it Matters": "Biosecurity failures turn single-hive issues into apiary-wide losses.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Flame-scorch or disinfect woodenware; rotate out old comb; avoid sharing frames between apiaries; quarantine incoming colonies; keep a disease log and photos.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Comb rotation pairs well with spring build-up and post-harvest periods.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Reusing suspect comb, moving kit between yards without cleaning, and ignoring minor brood issues.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Blowtorch or approved disinfectants, spare frames/foundation, labelled storage, and PPE."
