  "At-a-Glance": "Dry, well-ventilated hives winter better and suffer fewer mould issues. Remove moist air without chilling clusters.",
  "Why it Matters": "Condensation drips onto clusters, chilling bees and brood. Balanced airflow preserves energy and reduces disease pressure.",
  "Step-by-Step": "Use open-mesh floors where appropriate; ensure roofs are sound; add top ventilation or quilt boards in damp climates; tilt hives slightly forward to shed condensation; avoid large empty headspace above clusters in winter.",
  "Seasonality & Climate": "Maritime climates prioritise moisture removal; continental winters need protection from drafts while venting humidity.",
  "Common Pitfalls": "Over-sealing hives leading to damp, or over-ventilating so clusters struggle to maintain temperature.",
  "Tools & Materials": "Mesh floors, quilt boards, breathable insulation, entrance reducers, shims, reliable roof coverings."
