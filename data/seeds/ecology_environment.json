  "Overview": "Bees are essential pollinators, supporting biodiversity and agriculture alike. Environmental pressures threaten their survival and, by extension, food security.",
  "Drivers & Mechanisms": "Habitat loss, pesticides, climate change, and pollution each contribute. Neonicotinoids impair navigation; monocultures reduce forage diversity; warmer springs desynchronise blooms and bee cycles.",
  "Impacts & Case Studies": "Declining bee numbers reduce fruit set in orchards and yields in crops like oilseed rape. Urban wildflower corridors and hedgerows show how targeted action reverses trends.",
  "Mitigation & Best Practice": "Policies include the EU ban on key neonicotinoids and the UKâ€™s Pollinator Action Plan. Farmers can plant flower strips and cut pesticide use. Beekeepers can maintain resilient colonies with diverse forage."
