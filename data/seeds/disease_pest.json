  "Overview": "Bee colonies are vulnerable to a range of pests and diseases, from bacterial brood infections like foulbrood to parasitic mites such as Varroa destructor. These conditions are among the most serious threats to modern apiculture, capable of weakening or destroying hives if unmanaged.",
  "Biology & Transmission": "Each disease has its own biology. American foulbrood is caused by Paenibacillus larvae, whose spores remain viable for decades, while European foulbrood involves Melissococcus plutonius and often spreads in stressed colonies. Varroa mites reproduce inside capped brood cells, feeding on developing bees and transmitting viruses such as Deformed Wing Virus.",
  "Symptoms & Field Diagnosis": "AFB is identified by ropy larval remains and sunken cappings; EFB leaves twisted larvae and a sour smell; Varroa infestations can be monitored using sticky boards, sugar shakes, or alcohol washes. Consistent, accurate diagnosis is crucial to avoid colony collapse.",
  "Impact on Colony": "Diseases and pests reduce brood viability, shorten worker lifespans, and undermine colony strength. Colonies with high mite loads or brood disease often fail to overwinter, posing risks not only to individual hives but to entire apiaries.",
  "Control & Treatment": "AFB requires destruction of colonies by law in many regions, while EFB may be managed with shook swarms, requeening, or veterinary antibiotics. Varroa control includes oxalic acid, formic acid, thymol gels, and biotechnical methods such as drone brood removal. Treatments must be well-timed to coincide with brood cycles.",
  "Prevention & Good Practice": "Good hygiene, sterilisation of equipment, maintaining strong colonies, and routine inspections are key. Beekeepers are advised to keep records, avoid sharing combs, and apply treatments across the whole apiary to prevent reinfestation."
