> **At a Glance:** Write it down: term, access, liabilities, honey-for-rent, water, mowing, and pesticide notifications.

## Why it Matters
- Prevents misunderstandings and abrupt removals.
- Protects bees and relationships during spray events.

## Objectives
- Create a simple written agreement with contact tree.
- Define access windows, parking, and track wear.
- Set spray notification and water provision.

## What Good Looks Like
- One-page agreement + site plan + photo log.
- Emergency removal clause; security expectations.
- Exchange: jars, rent, or pollination credit.

## Step-by-Step
1) Draft terms: duration, hive count, reviews, termination.
2) Map entrances, stand area, water point; mark hazards.
3) Agree spray notifications (who/how/when) and buffer rules.
4) Share contact magnets/cards; annual review meeting.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Harvest/field work change access—avoid peak movements.
- Winter trucks damage tracks—plan alternative parking.

## Data & Thresholds
- Max hive count per site; revisit after first season.
- Notification lead time target (e.g., 48–72 h) for sprays.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Track damage -> Contribute repairs; change route.
- Spray surprise -> Review clause; escalate; relocate if repeated.
- Vandalism -> Add screening, signage, relocate if persistent.

## Common Pitfalls
- Handshake only agreements.
- Ambiguous hive numbers and access windows.
- No plan for stock grazing near hives.

## Tools & Techniques
- Template agreement, site plan, photo inventory on start/end.
- Gate codes log; reflective post markers.

## Safety & Compliance
- Public liability, movement IDs, warning signs.
- Risk assessments for farm yards.

## Field Checklist
- Agreement signed and filed.
- Spray contacts confirmed.
- Site plan shared with team.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Deliver a honey thank-you with the annual review.

## Further Reading
- Farm tenancy/licence examples.
- Pollinator-friendly farming guides.

## Notes
Add a simple ‘noise/visitors’ clause—prevents surprise school trips at bad times.
