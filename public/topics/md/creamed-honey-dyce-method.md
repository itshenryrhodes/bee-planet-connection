> **At a Glance:** Creamed honey is controlled crystallisation. Start with clean, low moisture honey, remove coarse crystals by gentle warming if needed, then seed with a known fine starter at a fixed ratio. Hold at a steady cool temperature until set, avoiding vibration. Jar at the right point for a smooth, spoonable finish. Repeatability lives in logs - temperatures, times, seed ratio, and batch IDs. Done well, you deliver a consistent texture buyers love without harsh heat or mystery outcomes.

## Why it Matters
Spreads are a reliable seller, but only if texture is dependable. The Dyce method offers a safe, reproducible path: homogenise, seed, hold, and set. Weak control produces chalky or coarse jars that dent trust. A simple kit - jacketed tank or insulated tub, a thermometer, and a cool room or cabinet - is enough at small scale. Write the method as an SOP, label creamed jars clearly, and keep them out of direct sun on the table. Over time your seed improves as you recycle a small portion of your best batch into the next. This builds a house texture and reduces waste from batches that set awkwardly. Consistency is the quiet brand builder.

## Step-by-Step
- If coarse, gently warm to dissolve crystals without cooking.
- Prepare fine seed from a previous ideal batch or trusted source.
- Blend seed at a fixed ratio and stir cleanly to distribute.
- Hold at steady cool temperature until set, then jar.
- Label and store cool and dark. Keep a small seed jar back.

## Seasonality & Climate
Cool months favor steady setting. In heat, use a controlled cabinet.

## Common Pitfalls
- Aeration from over stirring.
- Setting at fluctuating temperatures.
- No seed library - texture drifts batch to batch.
