> **At a Glance:** Artificial light disrupts bee orientation and foraging. Shield, shift, and screen apiaries near lighting.

## Why it Matters
- Reduces drift, night flights, and exhaustion.
- Improves overwintering and urban harmony.

## Objectives
- Audit night light sources and spectra.
- Re-orient entrances and install screens.
- Engage neighbours/sites on lighting tweaks.

## What Good Looks Like
- Warm-white, down-shielded fixtures away from entrances.
- Screens/hedges blocking direct beams; entrances face dark side.
- Reduced timer hours during peak seasons.

## Step-by-Step
1) Night visit: map direct beams, reflections, and timers.
2) Rotate hives 30–90° away; add 2–3 m screen/hedge.
3) Request shielded, warmer lights or timer changes.
4) Monitor drift piles and forager returns; adjust.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Winter dusk commutes amplify light exposure.
- Summer events/fairs add temporary floodlights—plan ahead.

## Data & Thresholds
- Count night fly-outs for a week before/after changes.
- Aim for ≤2700–3000 K lamps near apiaries when possible.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Piles of dead at lights -> Shield/relocate; add darker flight corridors.
- Drift to brightest edge -> Increase screen height; stagger entrances.
- Noisy nights -> Check insect predators; adjust light schedule.

## Common Pitfalls
- Ignoring reflective glass/walls.
- Assuming LEDs are harmless at any spectrum.
- No night audits—day visits miss the issue.

## Tools & Techniques
- Lux meter app, spectrum info, hedge netting.
- Entrance reducers and coloured landmarks.

## Safety & Compliance
- Roof and site safety at night visits.
- Permissions for fixture changes.

## Field Checklist
- Night audit done.
- Screens installed; entrances reoriented.
- Neighbours/site informed.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain ‘dark corridors’ to site owners in plain terms.

## Further Reading
- Urban lighting and pollinator notes.
- Best-practice shielding guides.

## Notes
Sometimes moving 3 m behind a hedge solves 90% of the problem—cheap and fast.
