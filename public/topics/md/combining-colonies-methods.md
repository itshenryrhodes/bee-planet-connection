> **At a Glance:** Combine weak with strong using controlled methods (newspaper, queen-right rules) to save resources and hit flow targets.

## Why it Matters
- Prevents limp colonies consuming time and kit.
- Improves survival and productivity.

## Objectives
- Choose the right combine method and timing.
- Confirm queen status before merging.
- Protect against disease and temperament problems.

## What Good Looks Like
- Queenless + queenright merge with newspaper; entrances aligned.
- Sick colonies excluded; aggressive stock culled before combine.
- Post-merge check for queen-right and space.

## Step-by-Step
1) Diagnose: queenless/weak vs diseased.
2) Kill/cage spare queen; equalise bees; place newspaper between boxes.
3) Pierce small holes; align entrances; provide space and feed if needed.
4) Inspect after 5–7 days; tidy frames; remove paper remnants.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Best before flows or autumn build-up.
- Avoid cold snaps with tiny clusters.

## Data & Thresholds
- Minimum frames of bees to justify independence.
- Temperament threshold—do not combine hot lines unless requeening.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Fighting at combine -> Too fast; reduce holes; add scent mist.
- Post-merge brood break -> Normal for a few days; verify queen in 7–10.
- Honey-bound after combine -> Add space; rearrange frames.

## Common Pitfalls
- Combining sick colonies.
- Not confirming queen status first.
- Merging during robbing dearth without reducers.

## Tools & Techniques
- Newspaper sheets, queen cages, entrance reducers, scent sprays.
- Quiet cloths; spare drawn comb.

## Safety & Compliance
- Do not move diseased equipment between yards.
- Record lineage and dates for traceability.

## Field Checklist
- Queen status confirmed.
- Paper placed with small holes.
- Follow-up scheduled.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain to helpers why we retire weak units instead of nursing forever.

## Further Reading
- Combining techniques compared.
- Case notes on autumn consolidations.

## Notes
Use a mist of thin syrup/vanilla on paper edge to soften introductions when edgy.
