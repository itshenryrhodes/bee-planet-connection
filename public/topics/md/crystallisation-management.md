> **At a Glance:** Most honeys crystallise. Manage it, do not fear it. Prevention starts with clean extraction, low moisture, and prompt bottling into warm jars. For smooth textures, seed with fine crystals or run a controlled warming step to reset coarse crystals. Use gentle warming - water jacket or cabinet - and keep below typical quality thresholds. Store cool and steady, not on a windowsill. Educate buyers with a small note on the label or a card: granulation is natural and reversible with a warm water bath. Honesty and simple care keep quality and trust high.

## Why it Matters
Granulation is chemistry plus handling. Rapid, coarse crystals are often a mix of nectar profile and post harvest practice. Good staging, filtering that avoids lots of fines, and steady storage reduce surprises. When jars set, buyers need guidance and you need a plan that protects aroma and enzymes. Overheating for fast fixes harms quality and reputation; a measured approach keeps character. Seeding and creaming are positive uses of crystallisation - you steer texture instead of chasing it after the fact. Clear care instructions reduce returns and build confidence that your honey is real and cared for, not industrially processed. Your choices here echo on stall days, in reviews, and in repeat custom.

## Step-by-Step
- Extract cleanly, bottle promptly into warm jars.
- Store tanked honey at steady cool temperatures to slow coarse growth.
- For set jars, warm gently in a water jacket or cabinet until crystals melt.
- Add label notes on granulation and home warming guidance.
- Consider seeding or creaming for stable fine texture.

## Seasonality & Climate
Cool autumn homes accelerate set - prepare care notes before the first cold snap.

## Common Pitfalls
- Microwave fixes that damage quality.
- Hot spots from direct element heaters.
- No buyer guidance causing avoidable complaints.
