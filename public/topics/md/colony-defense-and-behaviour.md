> **At a Glance:** Bees defend their nest using guards, alarm pheromones, and collective behaviours like balling. Defence intensity varies by genetics, season, weather, and beekeeper handling.

## Why it Matters
- Safety for keepers and neighbours is paramount.
- Calm colonies are faster to inspect and more productive.

## Objectives
- Select and maintain gentle stock.
- Design yards so flight paths bypass people and animals.
- Use smoke and handling techniques that minimise alarm.

## What Good Looks Like
- Calm veil contact, minimal pinging, steady frames.
- Entrances not facing public paths, screens lifting flight over 2 m.
- Aggressive colonies requeened promptly.

## Step-by-Step
1) Pre-inspection - choose warm, calm hours, avoid storms and dusk.
2) Smoke - 2-3 cool puffs at entrance and under crown board, wait 30-60 seconds.
3) Handling - slow, deliberate movements, keep frames vertical and centred.
4) Space - avoid crushing bees, keep burr comb trimmed.
5) If aggression rises - pause, smoke lightly, close up and return another day.
6) Persistent aggression - mark colony, plan requeening from gentle stock.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Hot, humid dearth periods increase defensiveness.
- Swarm season can reduce aggression temporarily.
- Cold snaps make bees testy and slow.

## Data & Thresholds
- Temperament scoring 1-5 - aim for 1-2 as standard.
- More than a few stings through suit per inspection suggests intervention.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Symptom: Follow-bees after closing -> Add screens to raise flight path -> Review yard siting.
- Symptom: Pinging and head-butting on opening -> Increase smoke slightly -> Reassess weather and nectar status.
- Symptom: Chronic aggression across yard -> Evaluate queen lines -> Requeen from known gentle source.

## Common Pitfalls
- Working in storms or during robbing.
- Rough frame handling and crushing bees.
- Ignoring neighbour complaints or livestock stress.

## Tools & Techniques
- Reliable smoker, clean fuel, spare veil, nitrile gloves under gauntlets.
- Entrance reducers and robbing screens.
- Windbreaks and privacy fencing.

## Safety & Compliance
- Maintain first aid kit and sting response plan.
- Record incidents and mitigations.
- Follow local placement guidance and signage norms.

## Field Checklist
- Weather suitable, nectar on.
- Smoker lit and cool smoke only.
- Plan for quick close if needed.
- Temperament note updated post-visit.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Keep a calm-colony breeding message in outreach materials.
