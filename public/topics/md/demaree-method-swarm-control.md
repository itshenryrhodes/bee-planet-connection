> **At a Glance:** Demaree relieves swarm pressure by separating brood from queen within one stack—maintains foragers and harvest while resetting urge.

## Why it Matters
- Controls swarming without major splits.
- Keeps foraging force and supers working.

## Objectives
- Execute a clear Demaree layout with queen below.
- Provide space and young brood management to suppress cells.
- Monitor and reset as needed over 7–10 days.

## What Good Looks Like
- Queen, one brood frame and foundation below with excluder; majority brood above.
- Plenty of drawn comb and space above excluder; supers on top.
- Follow-up: remove emergency cells; adjust frames.

## Step-by-Step
1) Find and cage the queen. Prepare spare brood box and excluder.
2) Bottom box: queen + one open-brood frame + empty/drawn comb; no queen cells.
3) Excluder, then empty super as a spacer (optional), then top brood box with remaining brood/food.
4) Return supers on top. Recheck in 7 days: remove emergency cells above; ensure queenright below.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Best just before or at first swarm signs in spring.
- Cold snaps: ensure adequate bees/heat in upper brood area.

## Data & Thresholds
- Trigger: cups with eggs/royal jelly or congestion signs.
- Follow-up checks at day 7 and day 10.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Cells persist above -> Remove; add more open brood below; give space.
- Queenless below -> Reunite with queen-right half or introduce caged queen.
- Honey bound below -> Add drawn frames; move food up.

## Common Pitfalls
- Leaving charged cells above to emerge.
- Too few bees below leading to brood chill.
- No space added, so pressure returns.

## Tools & Techniques
- Queen clip/cage, extra brood box, excluder, spare drawn comb.
- Marker pen and frame map.

## Safety & Compliance
- Lift safely—two people for tall stacks.
- Keep records for inspections.

## Field Checklist
- Queen located and marked.
- Layout correct: Q below, brood above.
- Day-7 cell cull booked.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain to helpers: ‘brood up, queen down, cells off at day 7’.

## Notes
Adding a spacer super between brood boxes eases congestion and improves heat flow management.
