> **At a Glance:** Learn the shapes: step-ups, night drops, dearth slopes, and storm loss. Turn patterns into timely actions.

## Why it Matters
- Better supering and harvest timing.
- Fewer wasted visits and missed flows.

## Objectives
- Standardise daily capture and annotations (weather, manipulations).
- Define pattern→action playbook.
- Share weekly snapshot to guide work.

## What Good Looks Like
- Annotated plots with clear flow bands.
- Actions logged (super on/off, moves) on the same timeline.
- Post-season review to refine rules.

## Step-by-Step
1) Plot daily nets and cumulative curves.
2) Mark events: supering, splits, storms, sprays.
3) Use thresholds to trigger jobs (e.g., 2 kg/day → super).
4) Compare yards; re-balance gear/trips.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Flow start/stop shift with weather—watch nights as much as days.
- Storms show sudden step-downs (washout).

## Data & Thresholds
- Day gain/loss bands; weekly net targets.
- Super-on/off rules and harvest cut-off.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Flat in expected flow -> Queen issue or forage shift; inspect sample hives.
- Night losses bigger than day gains -> Dearth; switch to dearth SOP.
- Big step-down without weather -> Robbing or theft; visit.

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to annotate changes.
- Comparing different hive sizes directly.
- Overreacting to single-day noise.

## Tools & Techniques
- Simple CSV → chart, or app dashboards.
- Yard comparison boards for planning.

## Safety & Compliance
- Secure scale platforms; lifting safety.
- Do not publish exact coordinates.

## Field Checklist
- Plots current; actions assigned.
- Spares staged for supering.
- Truck plan updated.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Share one weekly graph in team chat with actions.

## Further Reading
- Scale pattern catalogs.
- Case studies of yield vs pattern.

## Notes
Use moving averages to see the wood for the trees—less knee-jerk.
