> **At a Glance:** Carry the right cover and reduce risk: public liability, product liability, tools-in-transit, and event cover.

## Why it Matters
- Shields you from claims and venue requirements.
- Encourages risk-aware SOPs and records.

## Objectives
- Identify required policies for your activities.
- Maintain risk assessments and incident logs.
- Meet venue/vendor documentation expectations.

## What Good Looks Like
- Certificates stored in a ‘paperwork pack’.
- RA templates for apiary, markets, demos, school visits.
- Incident/near-miss records with corrective actions.

## Step-by-Step
1) List activities (retail, wholesale, demos, school visits).
2) Match policies and limits; collect certificates.
3) Create/maintain RAs and SOPs; brief helpers.
4) Review annually; update limits as business grows.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Storm season adds site hazards—update RA.
- Peak retail season increases stall/event exposure.

## Data & Thresholds
- Policy limits aligned to venue requirements.
- Renewal reminders 30 days ahead.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Issue: Venue asks for documents -> Send pack: insurance, RA, allergen note.
- Issue: Claim or incident -> Document immediately; photos and witness notes.
- Issue: Policy gap -> Add rider (e.g., product sampling).

## Common Pitfalls
- Letting policies lapse.
- No RAs backing the insurance when asked.
- Assuming home insurance covers stock/tools.

## Tools & Techniques
- Shared folder, renewal calendar, RA templates.
- Incident forms with CAPA fields.

## Safety & Compliance
- Accurate stall food hygiene; allergen signage.
- Driving/transport compliance for bee loads.

## Field Checklist
- Certificates current.
- RAs printed for events.
- Incident log up to date.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Brief volunteers on what the insurance covers—and what it doesn’t.

## Further Reading
- Small producer insurance guides.
- Association benefits and cover notes.
