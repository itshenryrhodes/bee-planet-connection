> **At a Glance:** Selling wholesale to shops demands consistent supply, clear pricing, and food-safety compliance.

## Why it Matters
- Expands sales beyond farmers markets and direct channels.
- Requires readiness for trade buyer expectations.

## Step-by-Step
1) Prepare wholesale price list (case volumes, unit costs, margins).
2) Ensure labels and packaging meet retail legal standards.
3) Document HACCP-lite and batch traceability records.
4) Offer samples and a short producer story to buyers.
5) Plan reliable delivery or courier logistics.

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-promising volumes.
- No insurance or liability cover.
- Weak shelf presentation compared to competitors.

## Safety & Compliance
Retail-ready honey and wax products must meet UK/EU labelling and food hygiene law.
