> **At a Glance:** Alternating drawn comb and foundation above the brood nest can relieve swarm pressure—use timing and strong colonies only.

## Why it Matters
- Manipulates nectar storage patterns to reduce congestion.
- Builds drawn comb inventory during flow.

## Objectives
- Apply checkerboarding ahead of main flow.
- Avoid chilling or disrupting brood nest.
- Review effect on swarming and yield.

## What Good Looks Like
- Only in strong hives with adequate bees.
- Alternation applied above brood nest, not through it.
- Follow-up to maintain spacing and prevent burr comb.

## Step-by-Step
1) Confirm strong colony and rising flow.
2) Place alternating drawn/foundation frames in top box/super.
3) Keep brood frames contiguous; avoid splitting brood.
4) Inspect for draw quality; adjust spacing; add more drawn comb.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Pre-main flow; avoid cold snaps.
- Heat waves: add ventilation to prevent wavy comb.

## Data & Thresholds
- Only use when ≥7 frames of bees and warm nights.
- Pull/replace any poorly drawn frames promptly.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Bridging mess -> Tighten frame spacing; ensure level hive.
- Brood chill -> Undo change; consolidate brood; wait for warmer week.
- No draw -> Too early/weak; add drawn comb instead.

## Common Pitfalls
- Splitting brood nest with foundation.
- Using on weak colonies.
- Letting wild comb develop unchecked.

## Tools & Techniques
- Frame spacers, drawn comb reserves, hive level checks.
- Quiet cloths to speed inspections.

## Safety & Compliance
- Careful lifting during flows.
- Hygiene when swapping frames between hives.

## Field Checklist
- Strength confirmed.
- Brood intact; alternation above only.
- Follow-up scheduled.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain goal: ‘space for nectar so brood isn’t backfilled’.
