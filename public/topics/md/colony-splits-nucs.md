> **At a Glance:** Splits manage swarm pressure, raise increase, and provide spare queens. Nucs are the safest way to grow apiaries.

## Why it Matters
Balanced splits yield sustainable expansion and insurance against queen failure.

## Step-by-Step
Choose strong donor colonies; move frames of brood, bees, and food; ensure queen-right/queenless status as intended; introduce mated queens or ripe cells; feed lightly until established.

## Seasonality & Climate
Best during rising nectar and when drones are abundant for mating; avoid late splits that cannot build winter bees.

## Common Pitfalls
Over-splitting, starvation, and queen introduction without a brood break or candy delay.
