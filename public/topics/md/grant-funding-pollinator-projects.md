> **At a Glance:** Good grants match funder goals with clear outcomes, simple budgets, and tidy reporting—small wins compound.

## Why it Matters
- Funds forage planting, education, and community kit.
- Builds partnerships and visibility for your project.

## Objectives
- Map suitable funders and their priorities.
- Write outcome-focused proposals with simple budgets.
- Deliver on time and report cleanly.

## What Good Looks Like
- Short proposal: problem → plan → outputs → outcomes → budget.
- Partners and permissions confirmed up front.
- Gantt, risk register, and monitoring plan in an appendix.

## Step-by-Step
1) Funder fit: read guidance; list eligibility and deadlines.
2) Design: measurable outputs (trees planted, sessions, m² of forage).
3) Budget: realistic costs, match/in-kind, quotes attached.
4) Delivery plan: roles, milestones, risks and mitigations.
5) Submit tidy pack; set calendar for reporting dates.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Planting windows and flowering times must match schedule.
- Heat/drought risk needs watering and species choice.

## Data & Thresholds
- Define KPIs (m² planted, pollinator counts, attendees).
- Photo points and before/after surveys set at start.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Issue: Budget squeeze -> Reduce scope; phase project; seek in-kind.
- Issue: Land permissions slow -> Switch to container plantings; adjust outputs.
- Issue: Monitoring weak -> Add simple transects and photo stations.

## Common Pitfalls
- Vague outcomes and no baseline.
- Over-ambitious planting with no maintenance plan.

## Tools & Techniques
- Template proposal, budget sheet, Gantt, risk log.
- Simple monitoring pack and photo map.

## Safety & Compliance
- Safeguarding/insurance for public events.
- Landowner permissions and pesticide-free pledges where relevant.

## Field Checklist
- Eligibility confirmed.
- Letters of support attached.
- KPIs and reporting dates in calendar.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Share wins with funders and community; credit partners.
