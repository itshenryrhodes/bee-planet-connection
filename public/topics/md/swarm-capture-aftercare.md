> **At a Glance:** After capturing a swarm, provide stabilisation and monitoring.

## Why it Matters
- Ensures swarm survival.
- Reduces disease transmission.

## Step-by-Step
1) House swarm in a quarantine box or nucleus hive.
2) Feed light syrup until comb is drawn.
3) Inspect for queenrightness within a week.
4) Monitor for disease before combining with other stock.

## Common Pitfalls
- Skipping disease checks
- Underfeeding in poor flow

## Safety & Compliance
Isolate new swarms per biosecurity protocols.
