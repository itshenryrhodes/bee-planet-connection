> **At a Glance:** Reliable mite data beats guesswork. Standardise alcohol wash, sugar roll, and natural drop so treatment timing is precise.

## Why it Matters
- Accurate counts prevent over- or under-treating.
- Comparable data across yards improves planning.

## Objectives
- Teach a single default method and a backup.
- Record sample size, brood state, and method.
- Turn thresholds into clear actions.

## What Good Looks Like
- Alcohol wash as default with 300 bees from brood frame.
- Counts logged with brood status and date.
- Decisions tied to thresholds, not hunches.

## Step-by-Step
1) Gather kit: cup, alcohol or sugar, jar, sieve, tray, sheets.
2) Sample 300 adult bees from brood area.
3) Agitate and count mites; calculate mites per 100 bees.
4) Record method, brood state, weather; decide per threshold.

## Seasonality & Climate
- Brood presence dilutes drop counts; use adult bee samples in season.
- Cold snaps reduce activity; avoid sugar roll in rain.

## Data & Thresholds
- Express as mites per 100 bees with sample size.
- Set yard-specific trigger bands for pre- and post-harvest.

## Diagnostics & Decision Tree
- Low counts but deformed wings seen -> Re-sample; consider brood test and lab.
- High variance between hives -> Increase sample number; check method consistency.

## Common Pitfalls
- Sampling foragers at entrance only.
- Inconsistent bee counts per test.
- No brood status noted.

## Tools & Techniques
- Marked 300-bee cup, mesh lids, white trays, tally sheets.
- Phone calculator or template to compute per-100.

## Safety & Compliance
- Alcohol handling safety if used.
- Dispose of liquids per local rules.

## Field Checklist
- Kit packed and labeled.
- Sample recorded with brood status.
- Trigger decision applied.

## Communications
- Short hyphens only.
- Explain why 300-bee samples give stable results.

## Further Reading
- Sampling method comparisons.
- Seasonal threshold guidance.

## Notes
Use the same jar and cup every time to keep consistency high.
