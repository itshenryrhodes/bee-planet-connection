> **At a Glance:** Wax moths exploit weak colonies and stored comb; prevention beats cure.

## Why it Matters
- Destroys comb and contaminates wax.
- Signals underlying colony weakness.

## Step-by-Step
1) Keep colonies strong and reduce unused space.
2) Freeze or stack combs tightly with moth control when storing.
3) Rotate out old dark comb which attracts infestation.

## Common Pitfalls
- Storing comb warm and unprotected
- Ignoring weak hives
