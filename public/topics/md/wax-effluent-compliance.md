> **At a Glance:** Wax effluent and wash water must be handled to protect drains and comply with local rules.

## Why it Matters
- Prevents blockages and fines.
- Improves processing hygiene.

## Step-by-Step
1) Filter solids before disposal.
2) Cool and skim fats; never pour hot wax to drains.
3) Store waste in labelled containers for proper disposal.
4) Keep logs for inspections.

## Common Pitfalls
- Pouring wax down sinks
- No records of disposal

## Safety & Compliance
Follow local trade waste/by-law requirements.
